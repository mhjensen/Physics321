    "### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homeworks are available approximately ten days before the  deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a scanned document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-6. You should upload the scan to D2L. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise (exercise 7 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",

    "### Exercise 1 (10 pt), math reminder, properties of exponential function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise is meant to remind ourselves about properties of\n",
    "the exponential function and imaginary numbers. This is highly\n",
    "relevant later in this course when we start analyzing oscillatory\n",
    "motion and some wave mechanics. As physicists we should thus feel comfortable with expressions that\n",

    "\n",
    "* 2a (4pt) One of the many uses of the scalar product is to find the angle between two given vectors. Find the angle between the vectors $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1,2,4)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=(4,2,1)$ by evaluating their scalar product.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2b (6pt) For a cube with sides of length 1, one vertex at the origin, and sides along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, the vector of the body diagonal from the origin can be written $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1, 1, 1)$ and the vector of the face diagonal in the $xy$ plane from the origin is $\\boldsymbol{b}=(1,1,0)$.

    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a scanned document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. You should upload the scan to D2L. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L."

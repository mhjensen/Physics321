It means that when you study the dependence on the parameter $\\beta$, you need to add $1$ to the power. Run your Sun-Earth code with these values of $\\beta$ and plot $x$ versus $y$ (you can use the same initial conditions or switch to eliptical orbits). Discuss your results. Can you use the observations of planetary motion to determine by what amount Nature deviates from a perfect inverse-square law?"

    "* For the value of $\\beta=2$ the orbit us stable, the amount by which the orbit of Earth deviates in this system is difficult to see visually. However, at $\\beta=3$, the Earth begins to spiral inwards towards the sun, its radius of orbit gradually decreasing. This is expected for a power of 3 in the denominator of the force between the Sun and the Earth. Since the Earth's orbit is less than 1 AU, as its radius decreases, the attractive force between the Earth and the Sun will increase. Earth also exhibits more unusual behavior when the equation describing the gravitational force has a power of $4$ in the denominator. From our studies we can conclude that for $\\beta=2$ we have stable orbits while for other values of $\\beta\\le 2$ we will not have stable orbits."

    "* When the simulation is run with Jupiter at its true mass, Earth orbits in the expected way, with a nearly circular path of motion with the Sun at a central origin.\n",
    "* The program is written to keep the Sun at a fixed point. Because of this, the full effects of increasing Jupiter's mass cannot be seen, because this scaled-up mass would have an effect on the Sun's position, causing it to move from its initial (0,0,0) origin. \n",
    "* Additionally, the way that this simulation is structured causes the alteration of Jupiter's mass to have little effect on Earth's orbit, despite this not being accurate with respect to the true effects of gravity in the solar system. The equations that govern the behaviors of the bodies in this simulation have been confirmed to respond to changes in mass of smaller bodies, i.e. changing Earth's mass by factors of 10, but this response is not seen for Jupiter in this specific construction of the system.\n",
    "* The true effects that are expected according to the physics governing the planetary bodies are much more significant. As Jupiter's mass increases in this 3-body system, it is expected that the attractive force between the Earth and Jupiter would cause Earth to considerably deviate from its orbit. This gravitational pull could potentially cause Earth to be ejected from its orbit around the sun, since multiplying its mass by a factor of 1000 would cause it to have a mass the same order of magnitude as the Sun, and thus have a net force able to possibly overcome the Sun's at some point in Jupiter and Earth's orbits."

    "* The results of this simulation proved to be what is expected for a solar system of bodies that obey the laws of gravity, and thus move under the influence of the inverse-square gravitational force.\n",
    "* As the planets become more massive and simultaneously have initial positions further from the origin (the Sun), they move according to the principles of bounded orbits– as discussed in Kepler's laws– with the Sun at one focus.  A closer inspection of Earth still reveals it to possess an orbit with a very small eccentricity when it moves under the gravitational influence of the remaining inferior and superior planets. To visually confirm that initial conditions of an orbit effect a body's motion in the way that is dictated by Kepler's laws, the path of Pluto was calculated and included in 3 dimensions. Its initial conditions did in fact cause its orbit to have its known tilt and higher eccentricity. As further confirmation of this, the orbits of the superior planets that are known to have higher eccentricities do display this behavior when their motion is simulated in this way using their measured positions and corresponding velocities at a specific moment."

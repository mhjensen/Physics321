\section{Building a Molecular Dynamics code}

In this project, you will learn the basics of a simulation technique called molecular dynamics (MD). 

Molecular dynamics is based on the assumption that even atoms move according to the laws of Newton, given the correct model for interactions. The goal of this project is to model a gas of  argon atoms, where the atoms interact according to the famous Lennard-Jones potential,
\begin{equation}
    U(r) = 4\varepsilon\qty(\qty(\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} - \qty(\frac{\sigma}{r})^6), \label{eq:lj}
\end{equation}
where \(r\) is the distance between two atoms, \(r=\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}\). \(\sigma\) and \(\varepsilon\) are parameters which determine which chemical compound is modelled. This potential is a good approximation for noble gases.

\subsection{Understanding the potential}\label{subsec:understanding}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Plot the potential as a function of \(r\) with \(\varepsilon=1\) and \(\sigma=1\), for example for \(r \in \qty[0.9,3]\).
    \item The behaviour of \(U(r)\) is vastly different for \(r < \sigma\) and \(r > \sigma\). Which term in the potential,~\vref{eq:lj}, dominates in each case and what is the effect?
    \item Find and characterise the equilibrium points of the potential.
    \item Describe qualitatively the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \(\num{1.5}\sigma\). What if they start with a separation of \(\num{0.95}\sigma\)?  (Hint: use the graph of the potential.)
    \item Describe the shape of the potential close to the stable equilibrium point. Can you think of other force(s) with the same behaviour?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Forces and equations of motion}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Find the force on atom \(i\) at position \(\vec{r}_i\) from atom \(j\) at position \(\vec{r}_j\).
    \item Show that the equation of motion for atom \(i\) is
    \begin{equation}
        \dv[2]{\vec{r}_i}{t} = \frac{24\varepsilon}{m} \sum_{j \neq i} \qty(2\qty(\frac{\sigma}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}})^{12}-\qty(\frac{\sigma}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}})^6)\frac{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}^2}.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Units}
Numerical accuracy is reduced when computing with values which are many orders of magnitude apart. This is often an issue in physics, and molecular dynamics is no exception. For example, the mass of argon is smaller than \(10^{-25}\ \si{\kg}\), while typical length scales are on the order of nanometres, \(10^{-9}\ \si{\m}\).

The remedy is to change units so that most quantities are close to \(1\). From~\vref{eq:lj} it is clear that \(\sigma\) and \(\varepsilon\) are the typical scales for length and energy.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Introduce the scaled coordinates \(\vec{r}_i\,'=\vec{r}_i/\sigma\) and show that the equation of motion can be rewritten in terms of these coordinates as
    \begin{equation}
        \dv[2]{\vec{r}_i\,'}{{t'}} = 24 \sum_{j \neq i} \qty(2\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^{-12}-\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^{-6})\frac{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}{\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^2},\label{eq:undim}
    \end{equation}
    where \(t'=t/\tau\) for a suitable choice of \(\tau\).
    \item What is the characteristic time scale \(\tau\), and what is its value for argon, which has \(\sigma=\SI{3.405}{\angstrom}\) (\(\SI{1}{\angstrom}=\SI{1e-10}{\m}\)), \(m = \SI{39.95}{\atomicmassunit}\) (\(\SI{1}{\atomicmassunit} = \SI{1.66e-27}{\kg}\)) and \(\varepsilon=\SI{1.0318e-2}{\eV}\) (\(\SI{1}{\eV}=\SI{1.602e-19}{\J}\))?
\end{enumerate}


\section{\underline{Two-atom simulations}}

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Write a function which solves~\vref{eq:undim} for two atoms and finds the positions and velocities of the atoms as a function of time. Implement three different integration methods:
        Euler, Euler-Cromer and Velocity-Verlet (see~\vref{app:verlet} for a description of the latter).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motion}\label{subsec:2motion}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Simulate the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \(\num{1.5}\sigma\). Use \(\Delta t'=\num{0.01}\), simulate until \(t'=5\) and integrate with the Euler-Cromer method.
    \item Plot the distance between the atoms as a function of time.
    \item How does the motion fit with your expectations from~\vref{subsec:understanding}?
    \item Repeat the previous tasks, but now with an initial separation of \(\num{0.95}\sigma\). Explain your results.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Energy}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Plot the kinetic, potential and total energy as a function of time for the two cases in the previous section.
    \item Theoretically speaking, should the total energy be conserved? Why, or why not? What about momentum?
    \item Does your program fulfil this? If not, what could be the cause?
    \item Simulate the same system as in~\vref{subsec:2motion} with the Euler, Euler-Cromer and Velocity Verlet algorithms, and compare graphs of the total energy as a function of time.
    \item Find the largest time step that keeps stable motion and conserves energy for all three methods (small fluctuations in energy are allowed as long as they are periodic and don't increase/decrease with time). Discuss your results.
    \item Link your experimentation to a brief discussion of the pros and cons of the three methods, both physically and computationally.
\end{enumerate}

The Velocity-Verlet method should be used for the rest of the project.

\subsection{Visualisation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Extend your implementation such that it writes to an \texttt{xyz}-file at each timestep (see~\vref{app:xyz}).
    \item Visualise the results of your simulations using Ovito (see~\vref{app:ovito}).
\end{enumerate}


\section{\underline{Large systems}}

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Implement a solver of~\vref{eq:undim} for \(N\) atoms, given initial positions and velocities.
    \item Use Newton's third law to reduce the number of force calculations.
\end{enumerate}

As you will experience, it takes a lot longer to simulate \(N\) atoms than two --- in fact the time increases as \(N^2\). One very simple way to reduce simulation times is to look at the expression (or plot) of \(U(r)\) and see that it goes very rapidly towards zero as \(r\) increases. This means that atoms far apart interact weakly, and the forces between them can be ignored.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., resume]
    \item Extend your implementation such that atoms more than \(3\sigma\) apart do not interact.
\end{enumerate}

This effectively sets the potential energy \(U(r)\) to be \(0\) for \(r\geq 3\sigma\). Since \(U(3\sigma)\) is not exactly equal to \(0\), the potential energy becomes discontinuous, which breaks energy conservation. The solution is to use a shifted potential, i.e.\ adding a constant such that \(U(3\sigma)\) is exactly zero.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., resume]
    \item Plot the shifted potential and the corresponding force to verify your implementation of the cut-off.
    \item Does the shift of the potential described above impact the force calculations?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verification}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
     \item Reproduce your results for the 2-atom model from the previous section to verify your implementation.
    \item Simulate the motion of four atoms starting at rest from the positions \([1,0,0]\), \([0,1,0]\), \([-1,0,0]\) and \([0,-1,0]\).
    \item Visualise the results in Ovito, describe and explain the motion.
    \item Plot the potential, kinetic and total energy as a function of time, and comment on the energy conservation.
    \item Repeat the above exercises with a small perturbation in the initial positions, such that the first atom starts at \([1,0.1,0]\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Initialisation}
While we are interested in simulating liquid argon, which will not be in an ordered structure, the simplest choice of initial positions is a regular crystal structure. Our choice of structure is the face-centred cubic lattice, as this is the crystal structure of solid argon.

The smallest repeating unit is called a unit cell, and each unit cell contains four atoms. When creating a structure of \(n\times n\times n\) unit cells, the atoms should be placed at

\hspace{0.1\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \centering
    \hfill
    \[
        \begin{bmatrix}
            i & j & k \\
            i & 0.5+j & 0.5+k \\
            0.5+i & j & 0.5+k \\
            0.5+i & 0.5+j & k
        \end{bmatrix}\cdot d\qquad \qquad\qquad
    \]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig.pdf}
\end{minipage}

where \(i\), \(j\) and \(k\) run from \(0\) to \(n-1\) and \(d\) is the size of one unit cell. One atom is placed at the bottom left corner of the unit cell, and the other three at
the centre of the three connected walls (see drawing above). This structure will contain \(4n^3\) atoms in total, and the total size of the simulation box will be $(nd)^3=L^3$.


\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Write a function which takes \(n\) and \(L\) (or \(n\) and \(d\)) as arguments and returns the positions of \(4n^3\) atoms on a face-centred cubic lattice.
    \item Verify your implementation by calling your function for \(n=3\) and \(L = 20\), writing the resulting positions to an \texttt{xyz}-file and looking at the result in Ovito. Your system should contain \(4\cdot3^3=108\) atoms.
    \item Show that the unit cell size corresponding to the density \(\rho=\SI{1.374}{\gram\per\cm\tothe3}\) is \(d=1.7 \sigma\). This will be used in the remaining parts of the project.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Many atoms, open boundary}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Simulate \(256\) atoms starting from rest, and visualise the results.
    \item Plot the potential, kinetic and total energy as a function of time. What is the main difference from the energy graphs for two and four atoms?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Boundary conditions}

In the previous exercise, you probably observed that the atoms
immediately spread out into a large volume, possibly with some
continuing to infinity (and beyond). This is not the behaviour we
want. Ideally, we would like to model the bulk behaviour of argon by
the use of periodic boundary conditions, although it can be finicky to
implement this efficiently.

To simulate bulk behaviour properly, the atoms should not only be
constrained to move inside the box, but should also feel forces from
neighboring images (copies) of the same box. i.e. if an atom is close
to the right-facing wall, it should feel forces from atoms close to
the left-facing wall, as if the two walls were connected.  To
efficiently calculate the shortest distance between atoms $i$ and $j$
across boundaries, the following trick should be used


\begin{lstlisting}
 dx = x[j] - x[i]
 dx = dx - round(dx/L)*L
\end{lstlisting}

where \texttt{L} is the size of the box, and \texttt{round} rounds up
to the nearest integer (see if you understand the logic behind this
calculation!). Periodic boundary conditions also mean that if an atom
leave the box on one side, it should reenter on the opppsite side.

If the implementation of periodic bounadry conditions proves to be too
diffucult or too slow, it's also possible to use \textit{reflective}
boundary conditions. Although it doesn't simulate bulk behaviour the
same way, it still gives reasonable results for the quantities that we
want to measure for larger systems.

Having reflective boundary conditions simply means that atoms that
would otherwise leave the box, are turned around. Calculations of
forces across boundaries are also neglected in this case.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Implement either periodic or reflective boundary conditions (or both) in your program.
    \item Run a simulation with \(108\) atoms and verify visually that your implementation works. Give the atoms some initial velocities of your own choosing.
\end{enumerate}



\section{\underline{Science}}

By now, you will have a well-functioning (if not terribly efficient)
set of tools for running molecular dynamics simulations. It is now
time to apply these tools to real problems. The goal is to reproduce
some of the main results from the first article containing proper
molecular dynamics (``landmark simulations'' according to
Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics\#History}}),
written by A. Rahman in 1964.

Section 4b) and 4c) (marked with *) describes two different ways to
find the \textit{diffusion constant}. You may choose to do only one of
the them, but we'll encourage you to do both. It's worth noting
however that a functioning implementation of periodic boundary
conditions is needed for section 4c.

\subsection{Temperature}
\paragraph{Measurement:} Temperature is one of the most important concepts in thermodynamics, and you will learn much more about it in FYS2160. As you may have learnt already, temperature measures the vibrations of atoms. This is formalised through the equipartition theorem, which for a monoatomic gas such as argon states that
\[
    \ev{K} = \tfrac{3}{2}k_\mathrm{B}T,
\]
where \(\ev{K}\) is the average kinetic energy, \(T\) is the temperature and \(k_\mathrm{B}\) is Boltzmann's constant. In a molecular dynamics simulation, the temperature can be calculated by using the equipartition theorem ``backwards'', i.e.
\[
    T = \frac{2\ev{K}}{3k_\mathrm{B}} = \frac{\ev{mv^2}}{3k_\mathrm{B}} = \frac{m}{3k_\mathrm{B}N}\sum_i v_i^2.
\]
The sum runs over all atoms.

\paragraph{Units:} Note that since we are using reduced coordinates such as \(\vec{r}\,'=\vec{r}/\sigma\) and \(t'=t/\tau\), a direct calculation from the equation above gives a reduced temperature \(T'=T/T_0\), where \(T_0 = \varepsilon/k_\mathrm{B}=\SI{119.7}{\kelvin}\). In reduced units, the temperature expression is simplified to
\[
    T' = \frac{1}{3N}\sum_i v_i'^2.
\]
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Extend your implementation with the calculation of temperature.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Initialisation of velocities:} Velocities in a gas are usually distributed according to a normal distribution, i.e.~a Gaussian function, as you can see in figure 1 of~\cite{Rahman_1964}. In order to initialise a system with a given temperature, each component of the velocity of each atom should be randomly chosen from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation \(\sqrt{kT/m}\). The following \texttt{numpy} command achieves this in reduced units:
\begin{lstlisting}
v0 = np.random.normal(0, sqrt(T), size=(N,3))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.,resume]
    \item Run a simulation with \(108\) atoms and an initial temperature of \(\SI{300}{\kelvin}\). Plot the temperature as a function of time.
    \item Find an initial temperature that makes the equilibrium temperature approximately equal to the \(\SI{94.4}{\kelvin}\) used in~\cite{Rahman_1964}. Plot the temperature as a function of time.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{*Velocity autocorrelation and diffusion coefficient}

The velocity autocorrelation, denoted \(A(t)\), is a measure of how
similar the distribution of velocities is to the initial
distribution. It is shown in figure 4
of~\cite{Rahman_1964}. \(A(t=0)=1\), since the velocity distribution
at \(t=0\) \emph{is} the initial distribution, while \(A(t)\)
decreases rapidly for \(t>0\) as the atoms collide with each other and
the velocities become less and less similar to the initial
distribution.

Mathematically, the velocity autocorrelation is defined as
\begin{equation}
    A(t) = \ev{\frac{\vec{v}(t)\cdot\vec{v}(0)}{\vec{v}(0)\cdot\vec{v}(0)}}
         = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \frac{\vec{v}_i(t)\cdot\vec{v}_i(0)}{\vec{v}_i(0)\cdot\vec{v}_i(0)},\label{eq:vacf}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all atoms.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Add the calculation of the velocity autocorrelation to your implementation.
    \item Run a simulation with e.g. \(256\) atoms (more if you can), and plot the velocity autocorrelation as a function of time. Compare with figure 4 of~\cite{Rahman_1964}.
\end{enumerate}

One cause of deviations is that the initial configuration of positions
and velocities (\(\vec{v}_i(0)\) in~\vref{eq:vacf}) should be an
equilibrium distribution.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.,resume]
    \item Use the final positions and velocities from the previous simulation as initial positions and velocities for a new simulation, and calculate and plot the new velocity autocorrelation.
    \item If your plot is very noisy (and your program does not run for too long), redo the two above simulations multiple times and average the velocity autocorrelation.
\end{enumerate}

The article also contains calculations of the diffusion coefficient
\(D\), as shown in figure 3. Here, it is calculated as the slope of
the mean squared displacement as a function of time. This requires
periodic boundary conditions, which we have chosen to omit from this
project. Fortunately, the diffusion coefficient can also be obtained
from the velocity autocorrelation, via the Green-Kubo relation,

\[
    D = \frac{1}{3}\int_0^\infty A(t)\dd{t}.
\]
While it is not possible to integrate to \(\infty\) in a molecular dynamics simulation, the rapid decrease of \(\abs{A(t)}\) ensures that a finite integral will give a good approximation. Use your previous plot of \(A(t)\) to determine a reasonable upper bound.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.,resume]
    \item Estimate the diffusion coefficient from your previously calculated velocity autocorrelation. Compare with the result from~\cite{Rahman_1964}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{*Mean squared displacement and diffusion coefficient}

A more intuituve and direct way to calculate the diffusion in the
system is via the \textit{mean squared displacement}, defined as

\begin{equation}
 \langle r^2(t) \rangle = \langle (\vec{r}(t) - \vec{r}(t_0))^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (\vec{r}_n(t) - \vec{r}_n(t_0)))^2.
 \label{eq:msd}
\end{equation}

This measure tells us the average distance the atoms has traveled
after a time $t$ as compared to their positions at a reference time,
$t_0$. It's important that $t_0$ is set at a time where the system is
already at equilibrium.

\textbf{Important note: Periodic boundary conditions are required to
  calculate the msd, as we need to keep track of where, and how many
  times the atoms has crossed the boundaries.} This means counters for
all atoms in all three directions are needed.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Add the calculation of the mean squared displacement to your implementation.
\end{enumerate}

Through the theory of brownian motion, it can be shown that the mean
squared displement is linked to the diffusion constant $D$ by the
following relation (in three dimensions):

\begin{equation}
 \langle r^2(t) \rangle = 6Dt \hspace{0.5 cm} \text{when } t \rightarrow \infty.
\end{equation}

As with the velocity autocorrelation, the relation to the diffusion
constant implies a simulation of infinite time, but the rapid
convergence of the msd ensures a good approximation also in this case.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., resume]
    \item Implement the calculation of the diffusion constant, and run a simulation for 864 atoms (fewer is also fine if the runtime is slow). How does your result compare to the one in~\cite{Rahman_1964}?
    \item (Optional) If your program isn't too slow, calculate the diffusion constant as a function of temperature \(D(T)\) for equilibrium temperatures in the range of \(T = [50 K, 120K]\). Plot the result and describe what you see. Google the element of argon, and see if you find something that's supposed to happen in the given temperature range. Can you link this to your results?   
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Radial distribution function}

The radial distribution function \(g(r)\) shown in figure 2
of~\cite{Rahman_1964} describes the distribution of distances between
an atom and its neighbours. It is defined as the ratio of the density
at a distance \(r\) from an atom and the average density, i.e.

\begin{equation}
    g(r) = \frac{V}{N} \frac{n(r)}{4\pi r^2\Delta r},\label{eq:rdf}
\end{equation}
where \(V\) is the total volume, \(N\) the total number of particles and \(n(r)\) the average number of particles at a distance between \(r\) and \(r+\Delta r\). \(g(r)\) should be calculated for all atoms and then averaged. An example implementation is given below. The output should be averaged over many timesteps for a smooth result. Note that while \(g(r)\) should approach \(1\) when \(r\to\infty\) in bulk, the finite system size causes \(g(r)\) to decay for large \(r\).
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Run  a simulation with as many atoms for as long as you can. Calculate the radial distribution function \(g(r)\), plot the result and compare with figure 2 of~\cite{Rahman_1964}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data file format}\label{app:xyz}
The \texttt{xyz}-format is a semi-standard format for storing data from molecular dynamics simulations. Each time step is stored in the following format, and there are no blank lines between timesteps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A line containing the number of atoms (an integer).
    \item An ignored line (this line is usually written as a header for the subsequent columns).
    \item One line for each atom, containing the atom type and the \(x\)-, \(y\)- and \(z\)-coordinates.
\end{itemize}
For two atoms simulated over three timesteps, where \texttt{xij} represents the \(x\)-coordinate of atom \(j\) at timestep \(i\), the file would look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
    2
    type  x   y   z     <--- This line is a read as a comment, and therefore ignored.
    Ar   x11 y11 z11
    Ar   x12 y12 z12
    2
    type  x   y   z
    Ar   x21 y21 z21
    Ar   x22 y22 z22
    2
    type  x   y   z
    Ar   x31 y31 z31
    Ar   x32 y32 z32
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Visualisation}\label{app:ovito}
Files written in the \texttt{xyz}-format can be read using the Ovito visualisation tool. It can be downloaded and installed from \url{https://ovito.org/index.php/download}.

When the installation has finished, simply open Ovito, click ``File'' \(\to\) ``Load File`` and choose your \texttt{xyz}-file. Edit the column mapping in the dialogue if necessary. When the atoms have appeared on your screen, check the box named ``File contains time series'' on the right-hand side, press \tikz[x=8pt,y=8pt]{\filldraw[fill=white] (0,0) -- (0,1) -- (0.866,0.5) -- (0,0);} and watch your atoms move around!


\subsection{Velocity-Verlet}\label{app:verlet}
The Velocity-Verlet integration scheme is based on a second-order Taylor polynomial. With \(\vec{r}_i(t)\) denoting the position of atom \(i\) at a time \(t\), the second-order Taylor expansions of position and velocity can be written as
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \vec{r}_i(t+\Delta t) &\approx \vec{r}_i(t) + \vec{v}_i(t)\Delta t + \tfrac{1}{2}\vec{a}_i(t)\Delta t^2\\
    \vec{v}_i(t+\Delta t) &\approx \vec{v}_i(t) + \vec{a}_i(t)\Delta t + \tfrac{1}{2}\vec{a}_i'(t)\Delta t^2.
\end{alignat*}
There is no explicit expression for \(\vec{a}'(t)\). It can, however, be approximated using our old friend
\[
\vec{a}\,'(t)\approx\frac{\vec{a}(t+\Delta t)-\vec{a}(t)}{\Delta t}.
\]
Since the acceleration is independent of the velocity, the newly updated position, \(\vec{r}(t+\Delta t)\), is sufficient to calculate \(\vec{a}(t+h)\). Inserting this into the expression for \(\vec{v}(t+\Delta t)\), we get
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \vec{v}_i(t+\Delta t) &\approx \vec{v}_i(t) + \vec{a}_i(t)\Delta t + \tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\vec{a}_i(t+\Delta t)-\vec{a}_i(t))\Delta t\\
    &= \vec{v}_i(t) + \tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\vec{a}_i(t)+\vec{a}_i(t+\Delta t))\Delta t.
\end{alignat*}
The discretised algorithm then becomes
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \vec{r}_{i,j+1} &\approx \vec{r}_{i,j} + \vec{v}_{i,j}\Delta t + \tfrac{1}{2}\vec{a}_{i,j}\Delta t^2\\
    \vec{v}_{i,j+1} &\approx \vec{v}_{i,j} + \tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\vec{a}_{i,j} + \vec{a}_{i,j+1})\Delta t,
\end{alignat*}
where \(\vec{r}_{i,j}\) is the position of atom \(i\) at timestep \(j\). In your implementation, you should avoid having to calculate the acceleration more than once per timestep.

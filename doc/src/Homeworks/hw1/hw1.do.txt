DATE: today

===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o Homeworks are available approximately ten days before the  deadline. 
o How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a scanned document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-6. You should upload the scan to D2L. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise (exercise 7 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. 



=== Exercise 1 (10 pt), math reminder, properties of exponential function  ===

The first exercise is meant to remind ourselves about properties of
the exponential function and imaginary numbers. This is highly
relevant later in this course when we start analyzing oscillatory
motion and some wave mechanics. As physicists we should thus feel comfortable with expressions that
include $\exp{(\imath\omega t)}$. Here $t$ could be interpreted as time and $\omega$ as a frequency and $\imath$ is the imaginary unit number.

* 1a (2pt): Perform Taylor expansions in powers of $\omega t$ of the functions $\cos{(\omega t)}$ and $\sin{(\omega t)}$.
* 1b (2pt): Perform a Taylor expansion of $\exp{(i\omega t)}$.
* 1c (3pt): Using parts (a) and (b) here, show that $\exp{(\imath\omega t)}=\cos{(\omega t)}+\imath\sin{(\omega t)}$.
* 1d (3pt): Show that $\ln{(−1)} = \imath\pi$.

=== Exercise 2 (10 pt), Vector algebra  ===

* 2a (4pt) One of the many uses of the scalar product is to find the angle between two given vectors. Find the angle between the vectors $\bm{a}=(1,2,4)$ and $\bm{b}=(4,2,1)$ by evaluating their scalar product.
* 2b (6pt) For a cube with sides of length 1, one vertex at the origin, and sides along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, the vector of the body diagonal from the origin can be written $\bm{a}=(1, 1, 1)$ and the vector of the face diagonal in the $xy$ plane from the origin is $\bm{b}=(1,1,0)$. Find first the lengths of the body diagonal and the face diagonal. Use then part (2a) to find the angle between the body diagonal and the face diagonal.

=== Exercise 3 (10 pt), More vector mathematics ===

* 3a (5pt) Show (using the fact that multiplication of reals is distributive) that $\bm{a}(\bm{b}+\bm{c})=\bm{a}\bm{b}+\bm{a}\bm{c}$.
* 3b (5pt) Show that (using product rule for differentiating reals)  $\frac{d}{dt}(\bm{a}\bm{b})=\bm{a}\frac{d\bm{b}}{dt}+\bm{b}\frac{d\bm{a}}{dt}$

=== Exercise 4 (10 pt), Algebra of cross products  ===

* 4a (5pt) Show that the cross products are distribuitive $\bm{a}\times(\bm{b}+\bm{c})=\bm{a}\times\bm{b}+\bm{a}\times\bm{c}$.
* 4b (5pt) Show that $\frac{d}{dt}(\bm{a}\times\bm{b})=\bm{a}\times\frac{d\bm{b}}{dt}+\frac{d\bm{a}}{dt}\times \bm{b}$. Be careful with the order of factors 


=== Exercise 5 (10 pt), Area of triangle and law of sines ===
Exercise 1.18 in the textbook of Taylor, Classical Mechanics. Part (1.18a) gives 5pt and part (1.18b) gives also 5pt.

=== Exercise 6 (10pt), Matrices and rotations in the $xy$ plane ===
The rotation of a three-dimensional  vector $\bm{a}=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ in the $xy$ plane around an angle $\phi$ results in a new vector $\bm{b}=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$.  This operation can be expressed in terms of linear algebra as a matrix (the rotation matrix) multiplied with a vector. We can write this as
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \\ b_z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} & 0 \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We can write this in a more compact form as $\bm{b} = \bm{R}\bm{a}$, where the rotation matrix is defined as
!bt
\[
\bm{R} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} & 0 \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

* 6a (4pt) Find the transpose of the matrix $\bm{R}$. We label this as $\bm{R}^T$.
* 6b (4pt)  This matrix is a so-called unitary/orthogonal matrix.  Show that $\bm{R}^T\bm{R}= \bm{I}$ where $\bm{I}$ is the so-called identity matrix with ones only along the diagonal. How would you interpret this result? For example, are scalar products changed under this transformations?
* 6c (2pt) Find the matrix for rotating a coordinate system by $90$ degrees about the $x$-axis.

===  Exercise 7 (40pt), Numerical elements, getting started with some simple data ===

_This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook_ at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). 


Our first numerical attempt will involve reading data from file or
just setting up two vectors, one for position and one for time. Our data are from 
"Usain Bolt's world record 100m during the olympic games in Beijing in
2008":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93dC0o2aHto". The data show the time used in units of 10m (see below). Before we however
venture into this, we need to repeat some basic Python syntax with an
emphasis on

* basic Python syntax for arrays
* define and operate on vectors and matrices in Python
* create plots for motion in 1D space
For more information, see the "introductory slides":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/week2/html/week2.html".
Here are some of the basic packages we will be using this week
!bc pycod 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
!ec


The first exercise here deals with simply getting familiar with vectors and matrices.

We will be working with vectors and matrices to get you familiar with them

o Initalize two three-dimensional $xyz$ vectors in the below cell using np.array([x,y,z]). Vectors are represented through arrays in python
o V1 should have x1=1, y1 =2, and z1=3. 
o Vector 2 should have x2=4, y2=5,  and z2=6. 
o Print both vectors to make sure your code is working properly.

!bc pycod
V1 = np.array([1,2,3])
V2 = np.array([4,5,6])
print("V1: ", V1)
print("V2: ", V2)
!ec

If this is not too familiar, here's a useful link for creating vectors in python
URL:"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.creation.html". Alternatively, look up the "introductory slides":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/week2/html/week2.html".

Now lets do some basic mathematics with vectors.


Compute and print the following, and double check with hand calculations:

* 7a (2pt)  Calculate $\bm{V}_1-\bm{V}_2$.
* 7b (2pt)  Calculate $\bm{V}_2-\bm{V}_1$.
* 7c (2pt) Calculate the dot product $\bm{V}_1\bm{V}_2$.
* 7d (2pt) Calculate the cross product $\bm{V}_1\times\bm{V}_2$.

Here is some useful explanation on numpy array operations if you feel a bit confused by what is happening,
see URL:"https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/overview-basic-numpy-operations".

The following code prints the first two exercises
!bc pycod
print(V1-V2)
print(V2-V1)
!ec

For the dot product of V1 and V2 below we can use the _dot_ function of _numpy_ as follows
!bc pycod
print(V1.dot(V2))
!ec
As a small challenge try to write your own function for the _dot_ product of two vectors.

Matrices can be created in a similar fashion in python.  In this
language we can work with them through the package numpy (which we
have already imported)


!bc pycod
M1 = np.matrix([[1,2,3],
             [4,5,6],
             [7,8,9]])
M2 = np.matrix([[1,2],
             [3,4],
             [5,6]])
M3 = np.matrix([[9,8,7],
             [4,5,6],
             [7,6,9]])
!ec

Matrices can be added in the same way vectors are added in python as shown here
!bc pycod
print("M1+M3: ", M1+M3)
!ec
What happens if we try to do $M1+M2$?

* 7e (4pt) Let us go back to exercise 6. Define a vector $\bm{a}=(1,0,0)$ and set the angle $\phi$ in the rotation matrix (rotation in the $xy$ plane) to $45$ degrees. Set up the matrix $\bm{R}$ and find the vector $\bm{b}=\bm{R}\bm{a}$.

To perform a matrix-vector multiplication of the above type, the following python code may be of use. Here we just define a random vector and a random $3\times 3$ matrix
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
#We define a  3 dimensional vector with random numbers
n = 3
a = np.random.rand(n)
# define a matrix of dimension 3 x 3 and set all elements to random numbers with x \in [0, 1]
R = np.random.rand(n, n)
#print the vector and the matrix
print(a)
print(R)
# perform a matrix-vector multiplication. Note that we need to transpose the vector and the odd way to indicate a multiplication with @
b = R @ a.T
print(b)
!ec

That's enough vectors and matrices for now. Let's move on to some physics problems! Yes, the actual subject we are studying for. 

We can opt for two different ways of handling the data. The data is listed in the table here and represents the total time Usain Bolt used in steps of  10 meters of distance. The label $i$ is just a counter and we start from zero since Python arrays are by default set from zero. The variable $t$ is time in seconds and $x$ is the position in meters.

|-------------------------------------------|
| i | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|-------------------------------------------|
| x[m] | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |
|-------------------------------------------|
| t[s] | 1.85 | 2.87 | 3.78 |  4.65 | 5.50 | 6.32 | 7.14 | 7.96 | 8.79 | 9.69 |
|-------------------------------------------|

* 7f (4pt) You can here make a file with the above data and read them in and set up two vectors, one for time and one for position. Alternatively, you can just set up these two vectors directly and define two vectors in your Python code.

The following example code may help here
!bc pycod
# we just initialize time and position
x = np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100.0])
t = np.array([1.85, 2.87, 3.78, 4.65, 5.50, 6.32, 7.14, 7.96, 8.79, 9.69])
plt.plot(t,x, color='black')
plt.xlabel("Time t[s]")
plt.ylabel("Position x[m]")
plt.title("Usain Bolt's world record run")
plt.show()
!ec

* 7g (4pt) Plot the position as function of time
* 7h (10pt) Compute thereafter the mean velocity for every interval $i$ and the total velocity (from $i=0$ to the given interval $i$) for each interval and plot these two quantities as function of time. Comment your results.
* 7i (10pt) Finally, compute and plot the mean acceleration for each interval and the total acceleration. Again, comment your results. Can you see whether he slowed down during the last meters?

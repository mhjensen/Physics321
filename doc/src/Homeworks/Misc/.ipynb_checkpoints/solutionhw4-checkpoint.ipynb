    "2. Homeworks are available Wednesday/Thursday the week before the deadline. The deadline is at the Friday lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical exercise(s) (exercise 6 here) should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",

    "This week's sets of classical pen and paper and computational\n",

    "of a conservative force, is independent on the path of the object. It\n",
    "depends only on the spatial degrees of freedom and it is possible to\n",
    "assign a numerical value for the potential at any point. It leads to\n",
    "conservation of energy. The gravitational force is an example of a\n",
    "conservative force.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to read more about conservative forces or not, Feyman's lectures from 1963 are quite interesting.\n",

=== Exercises 1-6 as handwritten note ===


===  Exercise 6 (40pt), Numerical elements, moving to more than one dimension ===

_This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook_ at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). 

Last week we:
o Analytically mapped 1D motion over some time
o Gained practice with functions
o Reviewed vectors and matrices in Python

This week we will:
o Practice using Python syntax and variable manipulation
o Utilize analytical solutions to create more refined functions
o Work in two, three or even higher dimensions

This material will then serve as background for the numerical part of homework 3. The first part is a simple warm-up, with hints and suggestions you can use for the code to write below. 

!bc pycod
# As usual, here are some useful packages we will be using. Feel free to use more and experiment as you wish.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
%matplotlib inline
!ec

In class (the falling baseball example) we used an  analytical expression for the height of a falling ball.
In the first homework we used instead the position from experiment (Usain Bolt's 100m record run) and stored this
information with one-dimensional arrays in Python.

Let us get some practice with this. The cell below creates two arrays,
one containing the times to be analyzed and the other containing the $x$
and $y$ components of the position vector at each point in time.  This is a two-dimensional object. The
second array is initially empty. Then we define  the initial
position to be $x=2$ and $y=1$. Take a look at the code and comments
to get an understanding of what is happening. Feel free to play around with it.


!bc pycod
tf = 4 #length of value to be analyzed
dt = .001 # step sizes
t = np.arange(0.0,tf,dt) # Creates an evenly spaced time array going from 0 to 3.999, with step sizes .001
p = np.zeros((len(t), 2)) # Creates an empty array of [x,y] arrays (our vectors). Array size is same as the one for time.
p[0] = [2.0,1.0] # This sets the inital position to be x = 2 and y = 1
!ec

Below we are printing specific values of our array to see what is being
stored where. The first number in the array $r[]$ represents which array
iteration we are looking at, while the number after the  represents
which listed number in the array iteration we are getting back. 


!bc pycod
print(p[0]) # Prints the first array
print(p[0,:]) # Same as above, these commands are interchangeable 
!ec
!bc pycod
print(p[3999]) # Prints the 4000th array
!ec

!bc pycod
print(p[0,0]) # Prints the first value of the first array
!ec
!bc pycod
print(p[0,1]) # Prints the second value of first array
print(p[:,0]) # Prints the first value of all the arrays
!ec
Then try running this cell. Notice how it gives an error since we did not implement a third dimension into our arrays
!bc pycod
print(p[:,2])
!ec

In the cell below we want to manipulate the arrays.
In this example we make each vector's $x$ component valued the same as their respective vector's position in the iteration and the $y$ value will be twice that value, except for  the first vector, which we have already set. 
That is we have $p[0] = [2,1], p[1] = [1,2], p[2] = [2,4], p[3] = [3,6], ...$

Here we set up an array for $x$ and $y$ values. 
!bc pycod
for i in range(1,3999):
    p[i] = [i,2*i]
# Checker cell to make sure your code is performing correctly
c = 0
for i in range(0,3999):
    if i == 0:
        if p[i,0] != 2.0:
            c += 1
        if p[i,1] != 1.0:
            c += 1
    else:
        if p[i,0] != 1.0*i:
            c += 1
        if p[i,1] != 2.0*i:
            c += 1

if c == 0:
    print("Success!")
else:
    print("There is an error in your code")
!ec

You could also think of an alternative way of storing the above information. Feel free to explore how to store
multidimensional objects. 




Assume we have a soccer ball moving in three dimensions with the following trajectory:

o $x(t) = 10t\cos{45^{\circ}} $

o $y(t) = 10t\sin{45^{\circ}} $

o $z(t) = 10t - \dfrac{9.81}{2}t^2$

Now let us create a three-dimensional (3D) plot using these equations. In the cell below
we write the equations into their respective labels. We fix a final time in the code below.

Important Concept: Numpy comes with many mathematical packages, some
of them being the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent. We
are going to utilize these this week. Additionally, these functions
work with radians, so we will also be using a function from Numpy that
converts degrees to radians.



=== 6a (8pt) How would you express $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ for this problem as a single vector, $\bm{r}(t)$? ===

!bc pycod
tf = 2.04  # The final time to be evaluated
dt = 0.1  # The time step size
t = np.arange(0,tf,dt) # The time array
theta_deg = 45 # Degrees
theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) # Converts degrees to their radian counterparts
x = 10*t*np.cos(theta_rad) # Equation for our x component, utilizing np.cos() and our calculated radians
y = 10*t*np.sin(theta_rad) # Put the y equation here
z = 10*t-9.81/2*t**2# Put the z equation here
!ec
Then we plot it
!bc pycod
## Once you have entered the proper equations in the cell above, run this cell to plot in 3D
fig = plt.axes(projection='3d')
fig.set_xlabel('x')
fig.set_ylabel('y')
fig.set_zlabel('z')
fig.scatter(x,y,z)
!ec

In the cell below we will put the equations into a single vector $\bm{r}$.

Then run the code and plot using the array $r$
!bc pycod
r = np.array((10*t*np.cos(theta_rad), 10*t*np.sin(theta_rad), 10*t - 9.81/2*t**2))
## Run this code to plot using our r array 
fig = plt.axes(projection='3d')
fig.set_xlabel('x')
fig.set_ylabel('y')
fig.set_zlabel('z')
fig.scatter(r[0],r[1],r[2])
!ec

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
%matplotlib inline

tf = 4 #length of value to be analyzed
dt = .001 # step sizes
t = np.arange(0.0,tf,dt) # Creates an evenly spaced time array going from 0 to 3.999, with step sizes .001
p = np.zeros((len(t), 2)) # Creates an empty array of [x,y] arrays (our vectors). Array size is same as the one for time.
p[0] = [2.0,1.0] # This sets the inital position to be x = 2 and y = 1

for i in range(1,3999):
    p[i] = [i,2*i]
# Checker cell to make sure your code is performing correctly
c = 0
for i in range(0,3999):
    if i == 0:
        if p[i,0] != 2.0:
            c += 1
        if p[i,1] != 1.0:
            c += 1
    else:
        if p[i,0] != 1.0*i:
            c += 1
        if p[i,1] != 2.0*i:
            c += 1

if c == 0:
    print("Success!")
else:
    print("There is an error in your code")

=== 6b (8pt) What do you think the benefits and/or disadvantages are from expressing our three equations as a single array/vector?  ===

This can be both from a computational and physics stand point. 
Computationally, it makes it slower to access a given time slot, because two accesses are necessary instead of one. It also takes up more space, requiring four pointers to arrays instead of merely three.

Physically, position is a vector, so it makes sense.  Perhaps a slightly more physics-related solution, which could also be useful computationally, is instead of having an array of x, y, and z, having an array where the t'th element s $(x[t],y[t],z[t])$.  This would be one memory lookup instead of three in order to get a position.

    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    tf = vi*np.sin(theta_rad)/4.9
    dt = 0.1

    x = t*vi*np.cos(theta_rad)
    y = 0*t
    z = t*vi*np.sin(theta_rad)-9.81/2*t**2
    
    r = [x,y,z]
    fig = plt.axes(projection='3d')
    fig.set_xlabel('x')
    fig.set_ylabel('y')
    fig.set_zlabel('z')
    fig.scatter(r[0],r[1],r[2])
    
    print("Maximum x:", tf*vi*np.cos(theta_rad))
    print("Maximum y:", 0)
    print("Maximum z:", (tf/2.0)*vi*np.sin(theta_rad)-9.81/2*(tf/2.0)**2)

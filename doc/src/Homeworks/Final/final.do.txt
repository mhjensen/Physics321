TITLE: PHY321: Classical Mechanics 1
AUTHOR: Final  project, due Friday April 30 at midnight (1159pm)
DATE: today

===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the extraordinary situation we are in now, the final projec should be handed in fully via D2L. You can scan your handwritten notes and upload to D2L or you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook.


=== Introduction to the final project, total score: 160  points ===

The relevant reading background is
o chapters 2-8 and 14 of Taylor
o lecture notes throughout the semester and previous homework and midterm projects.

The final project aims at covering most of the topics we have discussed during the semester. As a physical system to discuss many of the principles we have discussed during the semester, we will use what in the literature is called the _mathematical pendulum_ and variants thereof. 

=== Exercise 1:  ===



=== Exercise 2:  ===


=== Exercise 3, Coupled Harmonic Oscillators ===

Consider a mass $m$ that is connected to a wall by a spring with
spring constant $k$. A second identical mass $m$ is connected to the
first mass by an identical spring. Motion is confined to the $x$ direction only.

* _3a (10pt):_ Make a drawing of the system, set up forces and define variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ for the two masses.
* _3b (10pt):_ Write the Lagrangian in terms of the positions of the two masses $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* _3c (10pt):_ Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the  equations of motion.
* _3d (10pt):_ Find the analytical  solutions of the type
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_1&=&Ae^{i\omega t},~~~x_2=Be^{i\omega t}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
Solve for $A/B$ and $\omega$. Express your answers in terms of $\omega_0^2=k/m$.

* _3e (20pt):_ Write now a program which solves these two coupled differential equations for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Compute the positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ by choosing your initial conditions and compare with the analytical answers from 3d.

===  Practicalities about  homeworks and projects ===

o You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. _Remember to write your name(s)_!
o How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the extraordinary situation we are in now, the final projec should be handed in fully via D2L. You can scan your handwritten notes and upload to D2L or you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook.


=== Introduction to the final project, total score: 160  points ===

The relevant reading background is
o chapters 2-8 and 14 of Taylor
o lecture notes throughout the semester and previous homework and midterm projects.

The final project aims at covering most of the topics we have discussed during the semester. As a physical system to discuss many of the principles we have discussed during the semester, we will use what in the literature is called the _mathematical pendulum_ and variants thereof. 

=== Exercise 1:  ===



=== Exercise 2:  ===


=== Exercise 3, Coupled Harmonic Oscillators ===

The relevant chapters from Taylor are chapters 5-7 and the lectures notes on "harmonic oscillations":"" and the "Lagrangian Formalism and Calculus of Variations":"". Your codes from homework sets 5-8 and the first midterm may also be of interest.

Consider a mass $m$ that is connected to a wall by a spring with
spring constant $k$. A second identical mass $m$ is connected to the
first mass by an identical spring. Motion is confined to the $x$ direction only.

* _3a (10pt):_ Make a drawing of the system, set up forces and define variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ for the two masses.
* _3b (10pt):_ Write the Lagrangian in terms of the positions of the two masses $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* _3c (10pt):_ Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the  equations of motion.
* _3d (10pt):_ Find the analytical  solutions using a guess of  the type
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_1&=&Ae^{i\omega t},~~~x_2=Be^{i\omega t}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
Solve for $A/B$ and $\omega$. Express your answers in terms of $\omega_0^2=k/m$.

* _3e (20pt):_ Write now a program which solves these two coupled differential equations for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Compute the positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ by choosing your initial conditions and compare with the analytical answers from 3d.   


=== Exercise 1, Two-body Problems and Conservative Forces  ===

The relevant chapters from Taylor aree chapter 4 and 8. Homework sets 6-9 and the chapters on "forces":"" and "two-body problems":"" from the lecture notes may also be of use. 

This exercise is a follow-up of hw6. There we studied the so-called
Lennard-Jones potential which is widely used in molecular dynamics
calculations. This potential is based on parametrizations from
expertiments. In molecular dynamics calculations the assumption is
that atoms move according to the laws of Newton, given the correct
model for interactions. We can say then that quantum-mechanical
degrees of freedom stemming from the interactions between electrons
and protons in an atom, are parametrized in terms of an effective
potential.

We will limit ourselves to a two-body problem.

The goal of this exercise is to model a gas of argon atoms (here two
atoms only interacting), where the atoms interact according to the
famous Lennard-Jones potential,

!bt
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = 4\varepsilon\qty(\qty(\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} - \qty(\frac{\sigma}{r})^6), \label{eq:lj}
\end{equation}
!et

where $r$ is the distance between two atoms,
$r=\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}$, that is the norm of the relative
distance vector $\bm{r}$. The quantities $\sigma$ and $varepsilon$ are
parameters which determine which chemical compound is modelled. This
potential is a good approximation for noble gases like helium, neon, argon and other.

We start first with a basic study of the potential

* _1a (5pt):_ Plot the potential as a function of \(r\) with \(\varepsilon=1\) and \(\sigma=1\), for example for \(r \in \qty[0.9,3]\).
* _1b (5pt):_ The behaviour of \(V(r)\) is vastly different for \(r < \sigma\) and \(r > \sigma\). Which term in the potential, ref{eq:lj}, dominates in each case and what is the effect?
* _1c (5pt):_ Find and characterise the equilibrium points of the potential.
* _1d (5pt):_ Describe qualitatively the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \(\num{1.5}\sigma\). What if they start with a separation of \(\num{0.95}\sigma\)?  (Hint: use the graph of the potential.)
* _1e (5pt):_ Describe the shape of the potential close to the stable equilibrium point. Can you think of other force(s) with the same behaviour?
\end{enumerate}


Then we switch our attention to the equations of motion.

* _1f (5pt):_ Find the force on atom \(i\) at position \(\bm{r}_i\) from atom \(j\) at position \(\bm{r}_j\).
* _1g (5pt):_  Is this a conservative force? Show that the _curl_ is zero.
* _1h (5pt):_  Are linear and angular momentum conserved? You need to show this by calculating the relevant quantities.
* _1i (5pt):_ Show that the equation of motion for atom \(i\) is
!bt
\[
  \frac{d^2\bm{r}_i}{dt} = \frac{24\varepsilon}{m} \sum_{j \neq i} \qty(2\qty(\frac{\sigma}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}})^{12}-\qty(\frac{\sigma}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}})^6)\frac{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}{\norm{\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j}^2}.
\]
!et



Numerical accuracy is reduced when computing with values which are
many orders of magnitude apart. This is often an issue in physics, and
molecular dynamics is no exception. For example, the mass of argon is
smaller than \(10^{-25}\ \si{\kg}\), while typical length scales are
on the order of nanometres, \(10^{-9}\ \si{\m}\).

The remedy is to change units so that most quantities are close to
\(1\). From ref{eq:lj} it is clear that \(\sigma\) and \(\varepsilon\)
are the typical scales for length and energy.

* _1j (5pt):_ Introduce the scaled coordinates \(\vec{r}_i\,'=\vec{r}_i/\sigma\) and show that the equation of motion can be rewritten in terms of these coordinates as (where \(t'=t/\tau\) for a suitable choice of \(\tau\).)
!bt
\[
\dv[2]{\vec{r}_i\,'}{{t'}} = 24 \sum_{j \neq i} \qty(2\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^{-12}-\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^{-6})\frac{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}{\norm{\vec{r}_i\,'-\vec{r}_j\,'}^2},\label{eq:undim}
\]
!et
* _1k (5pt):_ What is the characteristic time scale \(\tau\), and what is its value for argon, which has \(\sigma=\SI{3.405}{\angstrom}\) (\(\SI{1}{\angstrom}=\SI{1e-10}{\m}\)), \(m = \SI{39.95}{\atomicmassunit}\) (\(\SI{1}{\atomicmassunit} = \SI{1.66e-27}{\kg}\)) and \(\varepsilon=\SI{1.0318e-2}{\eV}\) (\(\SI{1}{\eV}=\SI{1.602e-19}{\J}\))?
\end{enumerate}


We switch now to a numerical procedure and study the simulation of two interacting atoms.
* _1l (5pt):_ Write a function which solves ref{eq:undim} for two atoms and finds the positions and velocities of the atoms as a function of time. Implement three different integration methods: Euler, Euler-Cromer and Velocity-Verlet.
\end{enumerate}

* _1m (5pt):_ Simulate the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \(\num{1.5}\sigma\). Use \(\Delta t'=\num{0.01}\), simulate until \(t'=5\) and integrate with the Euler-Cromer method.
* _1n (5pt):_ Plot the distance between the atoms as a function of time.
* _1o (5pt):_ How does the motion fit with your expectations from~\vref{subsec:understanding}?
* _1p (5pt):_ Repeat the previous tasks, but now with an initial separation of \(\num{0.95}\sigma\). Explain your results.
* _1q (5pt):_ Plot the kinetic, potential and total energy as a function of time for the two cases in the previous section. Theoretically speaking, should the total energy be conserved? Why, or why not? What about momentum? Does your program fulfil this? If not, what could be the cause?
* _1r (5pt):_ Simulate the same system as in~\vref{subsec:2motion} with the Euler, Euler-Cromer and Velocity Verlet algorithms, and compare graphs of the total energy as a function of time. Find the largest time step that keeps stable motion and conserves energy for all three methods (small fluctuations in energy are allowed as long as they are periodic and don't increase/decrease with time). Discuss your results.
* _1s (5pt):_  Link your experimentation to a brief discussion of the pros and cons of the three methods, both physically and computationally.

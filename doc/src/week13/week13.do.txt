===== Stability of Orbits =====

The effective force can be extracted from the effective potential, $V_{\rm eff}$. Beginning from the equations of motion, Eq. (ref{eq:radialeqofmotion}), for $r$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
m\ddot{r}&=&F+\frac{L^2}{mr^3}\\
\nonumber
&=&F_{\rm eff}\\
\nonumber
&=&-\partial_rV_{\rm eff},\\
\nonumber
F_{\rm eff}&=&-\partial_r\left[V(r)+(L^2/2mr^2)\right].
\end{eqnarray}
!et

For a circular orbit, the radius must be fixed as a function of time,
so one must be at a maximum or a minimum of the effective
potential. However, if one is at a maximum of the effective potential
the radius will be unstable. For the attractive Coulomb force the
effective potential will be dominated by the $-\alpha/r$ term for
large $r$ because the centrifugal part falls off more quickly, $\sim
1/r^2$. At low $r$ the centrifugal piece wins and the effective
potential is repulsive. Thus, the potential must have a minimum
somewhere with negative potential. The circular orbits are then stable
to perturbation.


The effective potential is sketched for two cases, a $1/r$ attractive
potential and a $1/r^3$ attractive potential. The $1/r$ case has a
stable minimum, whereas the circular orbit in the $1/r^3$ case is
unstable.


If one considers a potential that falls as $1/r^3$, the situation is
reversed and the point where $\partial_rV$ disappears will be a local
maximum rather than a local minimum. _Fig to come here with code_

The repulsive centrifugal piece dominates at large $r$ and the attractive
Coulomb piece wins out at small $r$. The circular orbit is then at a
maximum of the effective potential and the orbits are unstable. It is
the clear that for potentials that fall as $r^n$, that one must have
$n>-2$ for the orbits to be stable.


Consider a potential $V(r)=\beta r$. For a particle of mass $m$ with
angular momentum $L$, find the angular frequency of a circular
orbit. Then find the angular frequency for small radial perturbations.


For the circular orbit you search for the position $r_{\rm min}$ where the effective potential is minimized,


!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\partial_r\left\{\beta r+\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}\right\}&=&0,\\
\beta&=&\frac{L^2}{mr_{\rm min}^3},\\
r_{\rm min}&=&\left(\frac{L^2}{\beta m}\right)^{1/3},\\
\dot{\theta}&=&\frac{L}{mr_{\rm min}^2}=\frac{\beta^{2/3}}{(mL)^{1/3}}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Now, we can find the angular frequency of small perturbations about the circular orbit. To do this we find the effective spring constant for the effective potential,


!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
k_{\rm eff}&=&\partial_r^2 \left.V_{\rm eff}\right|_{r_{\rm min}}\\
&=&\frac{3L^2}{mr_{\rm min}^4},\\
\omega&=&\sqrt{\frac{k_{\rm eff}}{m}}\\
&=&\frac{\beta^{2/3}}{(mL)^{1/3}}\sqrt{3}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

If the two frequencies, $\dot{\theta}$ and $\omega$, differ by an
integer factor, the orbit's trajectory will repeat itself each time
around. This is the case for the inverse-square force,
$\omega=\dot{\theta}$, and for the harmonic oscillator,
$\omega=2\dot{\theta}$. In this case, $\omega=\sqrt{3}\dot{\theta}$,
and the angles at which the maxima and minima occur change with each
orbit.
 

=== Code example with gravitional force ===

The code example here is meant to illustrate how we can make a plot of the final orbit. We solve the equations in polar coordinates (the example here uses the minimum of the potential as initial value) and then we transform back to cartesian coordinates and plot $x$ versus $y$. We see that we get a perfect circle when we place ourselves at the minimum of the potential energy, as expected.

Try to change the initial value for $r$ and see what kind of orbits you get.
In order to test different energies, it can be useful to look at the plot of the effective potential discussed above.

However, for orbits different from a circle the above code would need modifications in order to allow us to display say an ellipse. For the latter, it is much easier to run our code in cartesian coordinates, as done here. In this code we test also energy conservation and see that it is conserved to numerical precision. The code here is a simple extension of the code we developed for homework 4.

===== Scattering and Cross Sections =====

Scattering experiments don't measure entire trajectories. For elastic
collisions, they measure the distribution of final scattering angles
at best. Most experiments use targets thin enough so that the number
of scatterings is typically zero or one. The cross section, $\sigma$,
describes the cross-sectional area for particles to scatter with an
individual target atom or nucleus. Cross section measurements form the
basis for MANY fields of physics. BThe cross section, and the
differential cross section, encapsulates everything measurable for a
collision where all that is measured is the final state, e.g. the
outgoing particle had momentum $\bm{p}_f$. y studying cross sections,
one can infer information about the potential interaction between the
two particles. Inferring, or constraining, the potential from the
cross section is a classic {\it inverse} problem. Collisions are
either elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions are those for which
the two bodies are in the same internal state before and after the
collision. If the collision excites one of the participants into a
higher state, or transforms the particles into different species, or
creates additional particles, the collision is inelastic. Here, we
consider only elastic collisions.

For Coulomb forces, the cross section is infinite because the range of
the Coulomb force is infinite, but for interactions such as the strong
interaction in nuclear or particle physics, there is no long-range
force and cross-sections are finite. Even for Coulomb forces, the part
of the cross section that corresponds to a specific scattering angle,
$d\sigma/d\Omega$, which is a function of the scattering angle
$\theta_s$ is still finite.

If a particle travels through a thin target, the chance the particle
scatters is $P_{\rm scatt}=\sigma dN/dA$, where $dN/dA$ is the number
of scattering centers per area the particle encounters. If the density
of the target is $\rho$ particles per volume, and if the thickness of
the target is $t$, the areal density (number of target scatterers per
area) is $dN/dA=\rho t$. Because one wishes to quantify the collisions
independently of the target, experimentalists measure scattering
probabilities, then divide by the areal density to obtain
cross-sections,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma=\frac{P_{\rm scatt}}{dN/dA}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Instead of merely stating that a particle collided, one can measure
the probability the particle scattered by a given angle. The
scattering angle $\theta_s$ is defined so that at zero the particle is
unscattered and at $\theta_s=\pi$ the particle is scattered directly
backward. Scattering angles are often described in the center-of-mass
frame, but that is a detail we will neglect for this first discussion,
where we will consider the scattering of particles moving classically
under the influence of fixed potentials $U(\bm{r})$. Because the
distribution of scattering angles can be measured, one expresses the
differential cross section,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s~d\phi}.
\end{equation}
!et

Usually, the literature expresses differential cross sections as

!bt
\begin{equation}
d\sigma/d\Omega=\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta d\phi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta},
\end{equation}
!et

where the last equivalency is true when the scattering does not depend
on the azimuthal angle $\phi$, as is the case for spherically
symmetric potentials.

The differential solid angle $d\Omega$ can be thought of as the area
subtended by a measurement, $dA_d$, divided by $r^2$, where $r$ is the
distance to the detector,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
dA_d=r^2 d\Omega.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

With this definition $d\sigma/d\Omega$ is independent of the distance
from which one places the detector, or the size of the detector (as
long as it is small).

Differential scattering cross sections are calculated by assuming a
random distribution of impact parameters $b$. These represent the
distance in the $xy$ plane for particles moving in the $z$ direction
relative to the scattering center. An impact parameter $b=0$ refers to
being aimed directly at the target's center. The impact parameter
describes the transverse distance from the $z=0$ axis for the
trajectory when it is still far away from the scattering center and
has not yet passed it. The differential cross section can be expressed
in terms of the impact parameter,

!bt
\begin{equation}
d\sigma=2\pi bdb,
\end{equation}
!et

which is the area of a thin ring of radius $b$ and thickness $db$. In
classical physics, one can calculate the trajectory given the incoming
kinetic energy $E$ and the impact parameter if one knows the mass and
potential. From the trajectory, one then finds the scattering angle
$\theta_s(b)$. The differential cross section is then

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s}=b\frac{db}{d\cos\theta_s}=\frac{b}{(d/db)\cos\theta_s(b)}.
\end{equation}
!et

Typically, one would calculate $\cos\theta_s$ and $(d/db)\cos\theta_s$
as functions of $b$. This is sufficient to plot the differential cross
section as a function of $\theta_s$.

The total cross section is 

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm tot}=\int d\Omega\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=2\pi\int d\cos\theta_s~\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}. 
\end{equation}
!et

Even if the total cross section is infinite, e.g. Coulomb forces, one
can still have a finite differential cross section as we will see
later on.


An asteroid of mass $m$ and kinetic energy $E$ approaches a planet of
radius $R$ and mass $M$. What is the cross section for the asteroid to
impact the planet?

=== Solution ===
Calculate the maximum impact parameter, $b_{\rm max}$, for which the asteroid will hit the planet. The total cross  section for impact is $\sigma_{\rm impact}=\pi b_{\rm max}^2$. The maximum cross-section can be found with the help of angular momentum conservation. The asteroid's incoming momentum is $p_0=\sqrt{2mE}$ and the angular momentum is $L=p_0b$. If the asteroid just grazes the planet, it is moving with zero radial kinetic energy at impact. Combining energy and angular momentum conservation and having $p_f$ refer to the momentum of the asteroid at a distance $R$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{p_f^2}{2m}-\frac{GMm}{R}&=&E,\\
p_fR&=&p_0b_{\rm max},
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

allows one to solve for $b_{\rm max}$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
b_{\rm max}&=&R\frac{p_f}{p_0}\\
&=&R\frac{\sqrt{2m(E+GMm/R)}}{\sqrt{2mE}}\\
\sigma_{\rm impact}&=&\pi R^2\frac{E+GMm/R}{E}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et




===== Rutherford Scattering =====

This refers to the calculation of $d\sigma/d\Omega$ due to an inverse
square force, $F_{12}=\pm\alpha/r^2$ for repulsive/attractive
interaction. Rutherford compared the scattering of $\alpha$ particles
($^4$He nuclei) off of a nucleus and found the scattering angle at
which the formula began to fail. This corresponded to the impact
parameter for which the trajectories would strike the nucleus. This
provided the first measure of the size of the atomic nucleus. At the
time, the distribution of the positive charge (the protons) was
considered to be just as spread out amongst the atomic volume as the
electrons. After Rutherford's experiment, it was clear that the radius
of the nucleus tended to be roughly 4 orders of magnitude smaller than
that of the atom, which is less than the size of a football relative
to Spartan Stadium.



The incoming and outgoing angles of the trajectory are at
$\pm\theta'$. They are related to the scattering angle by
$2\theta'=\pi+\theta_s$.

In order to calculate differential cross section, we must find how the
impact parameter is related to the scattering angle. This requires
analysis of the trajectory. We consider our previous expression for
the trajectory where we derived the elliptic form for the trajectory,
Eq. (ref{eq:Ctrajectory}). For that case we considered an attractive
force with the particle's energy being negative, i.e. it was
bound. However, the same form will work for positive energy, and
repulsive forces can be considered by simple flipping the sign of
$\alpha$. For positive energies, the trajectories will be hyperbolas,
rather than ellipses, with the asymptotes of the trajectories
representing the directions of the incoming and outgoing
tracks. Rewriting Eq. (ref{eq:Ctrajectory}),


!bt
\begin{equation}label{eq:ruthtraj}
r=\frac{1}{\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+A\cos\theta}.
\end{equation}
!et

Once $A$ is large enough, which will happen when the energy is
positive, the denominator will become negative for a range of
$\theta$. This is because the scattered particle will never reach
certain angles. The asymptotic angles $\theta'$ are those for which
the denominator goes to zero,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta'=-\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

The trajectory's point of closest approach is at $\theta=0$ and the
two angles $\theta'$, which have this value of $\cos\theta'$, are the
angles of the incoming and outgoing particles. From
Fig (_to come_), one can see that the scattering angle
$\theta_s$ is given by,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:sthetover2}
2\theta'-\pi&=&\theta_s,~~~\theta'=\frac{\pi}{2}+\frac{\theta_s}{2},\\
\nonumber
\sin(\theta_s/2)&=&-\cos\theta'\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Now that we have $\theta_s$ in terms of $m,\alpha,L$ and $A$, we wish
to re-express $L$ and $A$ in terms of the impact parameter $b$ and the
energy $E$. This will set us up to calculate the differential cross
section, which requires knowing $db/d\theta_s$. It is easy to write
the angular momentum as

!bt
\begin{equation}
L^2=p_0^2b^2=2mEb^2.
\end{equation}
!et

Finding $A$ is more complicated. To accomplish this we realize that
the point of closest approach occurs at $\theta=0$, so from
Eq. (ref{eq:ruthtraj})

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:rminofA}
\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}&=&\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+A,\\
\nonumber
A&=&\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}-\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Next, $r_{\rm min}$ can be found in terms of the energy because at the
point of closest approach the kinetic energy is due purely to the
motion perpendicular to $\hat{r}$ and

!bt
\begin{equation}
E=-\frac{\alpha}{r_{\rm min}}+\frac{L^2}{2mr_{\rm min}^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

One can solve the quadratic equation for $1/r_{\rm min}$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}=\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+\sqrt{(m\alpha/L^2)^2+2mE/L^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

We can plug the expression for $r_{\rm min}$ into the expression for $A$, Eq. (ref{eq:rminofA}),

!bt
\begin{equation}
A=\sqrt{(m\alpha/L^2)^2+2mE/L^2}=\sqrt{(\alpha^2/(4E^2b^4)+1/b^2}
\end{equation}
!et

Finally, we insert the expression for $A$ into that for the scattering angle, Eq. (ref{eq:sthetover2}),

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:scattangle}
\sin(\theta_s/2)&=&\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, ~~a\equiv \frac{\alpha}{2E}
\end{eqnarray}
!et


The differential cross section can now be found by differentiating the
expression for $\theta_s$ with $b$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:rutherford}
\frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta_s/2)d\theta_s&=&\frac{ab~db}{(a^2+b^2)^{3/2}}=\frac{bdb}{a^2}\sin^3(\theta_s/2),\\
\nonumber
d\sigma&=&2\pi bdb=\frac{\pi a^2}{\sin^3(\theta_s/2)}\cos(\theta_s/2)d\theta_s\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{\pi a^2}{2\sin^4(\theta_s/2)}\sin\theta_s d\theta_s\\
\nonumber
\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s}&=&\frac{\pi a^2}{2\sin^4(\theta_s/2)},\\
\nonumber
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}&=&\frac{a^2}{4\sin^4(\theta_s/2)}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

where $a= \alpha/2E$. This the Rutherford formula for the differential
cross section. It diverges as $\theta_s\rightarrow 0$ because
scatterings with arbitrarily large impact parameters still scatter to
arbitrarily small scattering angles. The expression for
$d\sigma/d\Omega$ is the same whether the interaction is positive or
negative.


Consider a particle of mass $m$ and charge $z$ with kinetic energy $E$
(Let it be the center-of-mass energy) incident on a heavy nucleus of
mass $M$ and charge $Z$ and radius $R$. Find the angle at which the
Rutherford scattering formula breaks down.

=== Solution ===

Let $\alpha=Zze^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$. The scattering angle in Eq. (ref{eq:scattangle}) is 

!bt
\[
\sin(\theta_s/2)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, ~~a\equiv \frac{\alpha}{2E}.
\]
!et

The impact parameter $b$ for which the point of closest approach
equals $R$ can be found by using angular momentum conservation,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_0b&=&b\sqrt{2mE}=Rp_f=R\sqrt{2m(E-\alpha/R)},\\
b&=&R\frac{\sqrt{2m(E-\alpha/R)}}{\sqrt{2mE}}\\
&=&R\sqrt{1-\frac{\alpha}{ER}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Putting these together

!bt
\[
\theta_s=2\sin^{-1}\left\{
\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+R^2(1-\alpha/(RE))}}
\right\},~~~a=\frac{\alpha}{2E}.
\]
!et

It was from this departure of the experimentally measured
$d\sigma/d\Omega$ from the Rutherford formula that allowed Rutherford
to infer the radius of the gold nucleus, $R$.



Just like electrodynamics, one can define "fields", which for a small
additional mass $m$ are the force per mass and the additional
potential energy per mass. The {\it gravitational field} related to
the force has dimensions of force per mass, or acceleration, and can
be labeled $\bm{g}(\bm{r})$. The potential energy per mass has
dimensions of energy per mass. This is analogous to the
electromagnetic potential, which is the potential energy per charge,
and the electric field which is the force per charge.

Because the field $\bm{g}$ obeys the same inverse square law for a
point mass as the electric field does for a point charge, the
gravitational field also satisfies a version of Gauss's law,

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:GravGauss}
\oint d\bm{A}\cdot\bm{g}=-4\pi GM_{\rm inside}.
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $M_{\rm inside}$ is the net mass inside a closed area.

Gauss's law can be understood by considering a nozzle that sprays
paint in all directions uniformly from a point source. Let $B$ be the
number of gallons per minute of paint leaving the nozzle. If the
nozzle is at the center of a sphere of radius $r$, the paint per
square meter per minute that is deposited on some part of the sphere
is

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
F(r)&=&\frac{B}{4\pi r^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Now, let $F$ also be assigned a direction, so that it becomes a vector
pointing along the direction of the flying paint. For any surface that
surrounds the nozzle, not necessarily a sphere, one can state that

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:paint}
\oint \bm{dA}\cdot\bm{F}&=&B,
\end{eqnarray}
!et

regardless of the shape of the surface. This follows because the rate
at which paint is deposited on the surface should equal the rate at
which it leaves the nozzle. The dot product ensures that only the
component of $\bm{F}$ into the surface contributes to the deposition
of paint. Similarly, if $\bm{F}$ is any radial inverse-square forces,
that falls as $B/(4\pi r^2)$, then one can apply
Eq. (ref{eq:paint}). For gravitational fields, $B/(4\pi)$ is replaced
by $GM$, and one quickly ``derives'' Gauss's law for gravity,
Eq. (ref{eq:GravGauss}).


Consider Earth to have its mass $M$ uniformly distributed in a sphere
of radius $R$. Find the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration as
a function of the radius $r$ in terms of the acceleration of gravity
at the surface $g(R)$. Assume $r<R$, i.e. you are inside the surface.

{\bf Solution}: Take the ratio of Eq. (ref{eq:GravGauss}) for two radii, $R$ and $r<R$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{4\pi r^2 g(r)}{4\pi R^2 g(R)}&=&\frac{4\pi GM_{\rm inside~r}}{4\pi GM_{\rm inside~R}}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{r^3}{R^3}\\
\nonumber
g(r)&=&g(R)\frac{r}{R}~.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
The potential energy per mass is similar conceptually to the voltage, or electric potential energy per charge, that was studied in electromagnetism, if $V\equiv U/m$, $\bm{g}=-\nabla V$.

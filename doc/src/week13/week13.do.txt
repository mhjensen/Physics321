=== Code example with gravitional force ===

The code example here is meant to illustrate how we can make a plot of the final orbit. We solve the equations in polar coordinates (the example here uses the minimum of the potential as initial value) and then we transform back to cartesian coordinates and plot $x$ versus $y$. We see that we get a perfect circle when we place ourselves at the minimum of the potential energy, as expected.

===== Changing initial conditions =====

Try to change the initial value for $r$ and see what kind of orbits you get.
In order to test different energies, it can be useful to look at the plot of the effective potential discussed above.

However, for orbits different from a circle the above code would need modifications in order to allow us to display say an ellipse. For the latter, it is much easier to run our code in cartesian coordinates, as done here. In this code we test also energy conservation and see that it is conserved to numerical precision. The code here is a simple extension of the code we developed for homework 4.

===== Scattering and Cross Sections =====

Scattering experiments don't measure entire trajectories. For elastic
collisions, they measure the distribution of final scattering angles
at best. Most experiments use targets thin enough so that the number
of scatterings is typically zero or one. The cross section, $\sigma$,
describes the cross-sectional area for particles to scatter with an
individual target atom or nucleus. Cross section measurements form the
basis for MANY fields of physics. BThe cross section, and the
differential cross section, encapsulates everything measurable for a
collision where all that is measured is the final state, e.g. the
outgoing particle had momentum $\bm{p}_f$. y studying cross sections,
one can infer information about the potential interaction between the
two particles. Inferring, or constraining, the potential from the
cross section is a classic {\it inverse} problem. Collisions are
either elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions are those for which
the two bodies are in the same internal state before and after the
collision. If the collision excites one of the participants into a
higher state, or transforms the particles into different species, or
creates additional particles, the collision is inelastic. Here, we
consider only elastic collisions.

!split
===== Scattering: Coulomb forces =====

For Coulomb forces, the cross section is infinite because the range of
the Coulomb force is infinite, but for interactions such as the strong
interaction in nuclear or particle physics, there is no long-range
force and cross-sections are finite. Even for Coulomb forces, the part
of the cross section that corresponds to a specific scattering angle,
$d\sigma/d\Omega$, which is a function of the scattering angle
$\theta_s$ is still finite.

If a particle travels through a thin target, the chance the particle
scatters is $P_{\rm scatt}=\sigma dN/dA$, where $dN/dA$ is the number
of scattering centers per area the particle encounters. If the density
of the target is $\rho$ particles per volume, and if the thickness of
the target is $t$, the areal density (number of target scatterers per
area) is $dN/dA=\rho t$. Because one wishes to quantify the collisions
independently of the target, experimentalists measure scattering
probabilities, then divide by the areal density to obtain
cross-sections,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma=\frac{P_{\rm scatt}}{dN/dA}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Scattering, more details =====

Instead of merely stating that a particle collided, one can measure
the probability the particle scattered by a given angle. The
scattering angle $\theta_s$ is defined so that at zero the particle is
unscattered and at $\theta_s=\pi$ the particle is scattered directly
backward. Scattering angles are often described in the center-of-mass
frame, but that is a detail we will neglect for this first discussion,
where we will consider the scattering of particles moving classically
under the influence of fixed potentials $U(\bm{r})$. Because the
distribution of scattering angles can be measured, one expresses the
differential cross section,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s~d\phi}.
\end{equation}
!et

Usually, the literature expresses differential cross sections as

!bt
\begin{equation}
d\sigma/d\Omega=\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta d\phi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta},
\end{equation}
!et

where the last equivalency is true when the scattering does not depend
on the azimuthal angle $\phi$, as is the case for spherically
symmetric potentials.

The differential solid angle $d\Omega$ can be thought of as the area
subtended by a measurement, $dA_d$, divided by $r^2$, where $r$ is the
distance to the detector,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
dA_d=r^2 d\Omega.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

With this definition $d\sigma/d\Omega$ is independent of the distance
from which one places the detector, or the size of the detector (as
long as it is small).


!split
=====  Differential scattering cross sections =====

Differential scattering cross sections are calculated by assuming a
random distribution of impact parameters $b$. These represent the
distance in the $xy$ plane for particles moving in the $z$ direction
relative to the scattering center. An impact parameter $b=0$ refers to
being aimed directly at the target's center. The impact parameter
describes the transverse distance from the $z=0$ axis for the
trajectory when it is still far away from the scattering center and
has not yet passed it. The differential cross section can be expressed
in terms of the impact parameter,

!bt
\begin{equation}
d\sigma=2\pi bdb,
\end{equation}
!et

which is the area of a thin ring of radius $b$ and thickness $db$. In
classical physics, one can calculate the trajectory given the incoming
kinetic energy $E$ and the impact parameter if one knows the mass and
potential.


!split
===== More on Differential  Cross Sections =====

From the trajectory, one then finds the scattering angle
$\theta_s(b)$. The differential cross section is then

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s}=b\frac{db}{d\cos\theta_s}=\frac{b}{(d/db)\cos\theta_s(b)}.
\end{equation}
!et

Typically, one would calculate $\cos\theta_s$ and $(d/db)\cos\theta_s$
as functions of $b$. This is sufficient to plot the differential cross
section as a function of $\theta_s$.

The total cross section is 

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm tot}=\int d\Omega\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=2\pi\int d\cos\theta_s~\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}. 
\end{equation}
!et

Even if the total cross section is infinite, e.g. Coulomb forces, one
can still have a finite differential cross section as we will see
later on.

===== Rutherford Scattering =====

This refers to the calculation of $d\sigma/d\Omega$ due to an inverse
square force, $F_{12}=\pm\alpha/r^2$ for repulsive/attractive
interaction. Rutherford compared the scattering of $\alpha$ particles
($^4$He nuclei) off of a nucleus and found the scattering angle at
which the formula began to fail. This corresponded to the impact
parameter for which the trajectories would strike the nucleus. This
provided the first measure of the size of the atomic nucleus. At the
time, the distribution of the positive charge (the protons) was
considered to be just as spread out amongst the atomic volume as the
electrons. After Rutherford's experiment, it was clear that the radius
of the nucleus tended to be roughly 4 orders of magnitude smaller than
that of the atom, which is less than the size of a football relative
to Spartan Stadium.


!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, more details =====



In order to calculate differential cross section, we must find how the
impact parameter is related to the scattering angle. This requires
analysis of the trajectory. We consider our previous expression for
the trajectory where we derived the elliptic form for the trajectory,
For that case we considered an attractive
force with the particle's energy being negative, i.e. it was
bound. However, the same form will work for positive energy, and
repulsive forces can be considered by simple flipping the sign of
$\alpha$. For positive energies, the trajectories will be hyperbolas,
rather than ellipses, with the asymptotes of the trajectories
representing the directions of the incoming and outgoing
tracks.

!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, final trajectories =====


We have


!bt
\begin{equation}label{eq:ruthtraj}
r=\frac{1}{\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+A\cos\theta}.
\end{equation}
!et

Once $A$ is large enough, which will happen when the energy is
positive, the denominator will become negative for a range of
$\theta$. This is because the scattered particle will never reach
certain angles. The asymptotic angles $\theta'$ are those for which
the denominator goes to zero,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta'=-\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}.
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, Closest Approach =====



The trajectory's point of closest approach is at $\theta=0$ and the
two angles $\theta'$, which have this value of $\cos\theta'$, are the
angles of the incoming and outgoing particles. From
Fig (_to come_), one can see that the scattering angle
$\theta_s$ is given by,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:sthetover2}
2\theta'-\pi&=&\theta_s,~~~\theta'=\frac{\pi}{2}+\frac{\theta_s}{2},\\
\nonumber
\sin(\theta_s/2)&=&-\cos\theta'\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Now that we have $\theta_s$ in terms of $m,\alpha,L$ and $A$, we wish
to re-express $L$ and $A$ in terms of the impact parameter $b$ and the
energy $E$. This will set us up to calculate the differential cross
section, which requires knowing $db/d\theta_s$. It is easy to write
the angular momentum as

!bt
\begin{equation}
L^2=p_0^2b^2=2mEb^2.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, getting there =====


Finding $A$ is more complicated. To accomplish this we realize that
the point of closest approach occurs at $\theta=0$, so from
Eq. (ref{eq:ruthtraj})

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:rminofA}
\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}&=&\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+A,\\
\nonumber
A&=&\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}-\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

Next, $r_{\rm min}$ can be found in terms of the energy because at the
point of closest approach the kinetic energy is due purely to the
motion perpendicular to $\hat{r}$ and

!bt
\begin{equation}
E=-\frac{\alpha}{r_{\rm min}}+\frac{L^2}{2mr_{\rm min}^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, More Manipulations =====

One can solve the quadratic equation for $1/r_{\rm min}$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_{\rm min}}=\frac{m\alpha}{L^2}+\sqrt{(m\alpha/L^2)^2+2mE/L^2}.
\end{equation}
!et

We can plug the expression for $r_{\rm min}$ into the expression for $A$, Eq. (ref{eq:rminofA}),

!bt
\begin{equation}
A=\sqrt{(m\alpha/L^2)^2+2mE/L^2}=\sqrt{(\alpha^2/(4E^2b^4)+1/b^2}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, final expression =====

Finally, we insert the expression for $A$ into that for the scattering angle, Eq. (ref{eq:sthetover2}),

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:scattangle}
\sin(\theta_s/2)&=&\frac{m\alpha}{AL^2}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, ~~a\equiv \frac{\alpha}{2E}
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, the Differential Cross Section =====



The differential cross section can now be found by differentiating the
expression for $\theta_s$ with $b$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:rutherford}
\frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta_s/2)d\theta_s&=&\frac{ab~db}{(a^2+b^2)^{3/2}}=\frac{bdb}{a^2}\sin^3(\theta_s/2),\\
\nonumber
d\sigma&=&2\pi bdb=\frac{\pi a^2}{\sin^3(\theta_s/2)}\cos(\theta_s/2)d\theta_s\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{\pi a^2}{2\sin^4(\theta_s/2)}\sin\theta_s d\theta_s\\
\nonumber
\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_s}&=&\frac{\pi a^2}{2\sin^4(\theta_s/2)},\\
\nonumber
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}&=&\frac{a^2}{4\sin^4(\theta_s/2)}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

where $a= \alpha/2E$. This the Rutherford formula for the differential
cross section. It diverges as $\theta_s\rightarrow 0$ because
scatterings with arbitrarily large impact parameters still scatter to
arbitrarily small scattering angles. The expression for
$d\sigma/d\Omega$ is the same whether the interaction is positive or
negative.


!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, Example =====


Consider a particle of mass $m$ and charge $z$ with kinetic energy $E$
(Let it be the center-of-mass energy) incident on a heavy nucleus of
mass $M$ and charge $Z$ and radius $R$. We want to find the angle at which the
Rutherford scattering formula breaks down.

Let $\alpha=Zze^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$. The scattering angle in Eq. (ref{eq:scattangle}) is 

!bt
\[
\sin(\theta_s/2)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, ~~a\equiv \frac{\alpha}{2E}.
\]
!et

The impact parameter $b$ for which the point of closest approach
equals $R$ can be found by using angular momentum conservation,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_0b&=&b\sqrt{2mE}=Rp_f=R\sqrt{2m(E-\alpha/R)},\\
b&=&R\frac{\sqrt{2m(E-\alpha/R)}}{\sqrt{2mE}}\\
&=&R\sqrt{1-\frac{\alpha}{ER}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Rutherford Scattering, Example, wrapping up =====



Putting these together

!bt
\[
\theta_s=2\sin^{-1}\left\{
\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+R^2(1-\alpha/(RE))}}
\right\},~~~a=\frac{\alpha}{2E}.
\]
!et

It was from this departure of the experimentally measured
$d\sigma/d\Omega$ from the Rutherford formula that allowed Rutherford
to infer the radius of the gold nucleus, $R$.

===== Examples of Lagrangian theory: Small Vibrations and Normal Modes =====

Two examples are provided for solving for normal modes. These are
solutions with multiple generalized coordinates, where the motion is
that of simple harmonic motion. However, the motion is only simple for
a particular set of coordinates $q_1$ and $q_2$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
q_1&=&A\cos(\omega_1 t),\\
\nonumber
q_2&=&B\cos(\omega_2 t),
\end{eqnarray}
!et


while it is not necessarily simple in other coordinates. For example
if $x=q_1+q_2$, and $y=q_1-q_2$, the $x$ and $y$ motions will contain
mixtures of multiple frequencies. For many problems, or in the limit
of small vibrations about a minimum, there is some coordinate system
where the motion is simple. These are normal modes. Characterizing the
normal modes involves finding the frequencies, $\omega_i$, and the
coordinate system where the motion is simple for each coordinate. This
involves finding the direction, or the linear combination of $x_i$
that form the coordinates $q_i$ in which the motion is that of a
single oscillator in each coordinate.

!split
===== Coupled Springs =====

For a first example, we consider a system of springs, where we write
the Lagrangian, then find the normal modes. For the second example, a
double pendulum is considered. In this case, one must first make a
small angle expansion before finding the modes. In principle, problems
could have the same number of normal modes a degrees of freedom. For
example, a system of 7 particles moving in three dimensions has 21
degrees of freedom. However, some of the degrees of freedom do not
have oscillatory behavior. For example, for a rigid body in free
space, the angles describing the orientation evolve, but do not
oscillate. Also, the center-of-mass coordinates of a system of
particles isolated from outside particles moves at constant
velocity. One can also describe these as normal modes, but acknowledge
that their characteristic frequency is zero, as there are no restoring
forces.

!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 1 =====

Consider two springs, whose relaxed lengths are $\ell$, connected to three masses as depicted in the figure here. Describe the two normal modes of the motion. We can write the Lagrangian as

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{L}&=&\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}_1^2+m\dot{x}_2^2+\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}_3^2
-\frac{k}{2}(x_2-x_1-\ell)^2-\frac{k}{2}(x_3-x_2-\ell)^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

There are three coordinates, thus there are three equations of motion,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
m\ddot{x}_1&=&-k(x_1-x_2+\ell)\\
2m\ddot{x}_2&=&-k(x_2-x_1-\ell)-k(x_2-x_3+\ell)\\
&=&-k(2x_2-x_1-x_3)\\
m\ddot{x}_3&=&-k(x_3-x_2+\ell).
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 2 =====

This is a bit complicated because the center-of-mass motion does not easily separate from the three equations. Instead, choose the following coordinates,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
X&=&\frac{x_1+2x_2+x_3}{4},\\
q_1&=&x_1-x_2+\ell,\\
q_3&=&x_3-x_2-\ell.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 3 =====


In these coordinates the potential energy only involves two coordinates,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
U&=&\frac{k}{2}(q_1^2+q_3^2).
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

To express the kinetic energy express $x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$ in terms of
$X$, $q_1$ and $q_3$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_1&=&(3q_1-q_3-4\ell+4X)/4,\\
x_2&=&(4X-q_1-q_3)/4,\\
x_3&=&(3q_3-q_1+4\ell+4X)/4.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 4 =====

The kinetic energy and Lagrangian are them

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
T&=&\frac{m}{2}\frac{1}{16}(3\dot{q}_1-\dot{q}_3+4\dot{X})^2
+m\frac{1}{16}(4\dot{X}-\dot{q}_1-\dot{q}_3)^2
+\frac{m}{2}\frac{1}{16}(3\dot{q}_3-\dot{q}_1+4\dot{X})^2\\
&=&\frac{3m}{8}(\dot{q}_1^2+\dot{q}_3^2)-\frac{m}{4}\dot{q}_1\dot{q}_3
+2m\dot{X}^2,\\
\mathcal{L}&=&\frac{3m}{8}(\dot{q}_1^2+\dot{q}_3^2)-\frac{m}{4}\dot{q}_1\dot{q}_3
+2m\dot{X}^2-\frac{k}{2}q_1^2-\frac{k}{2}q_3^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

The three equations of motion are then,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{3}{4}m\ddot{q}_1-\frac{1}{4}m\ddot{q}_3&=&-kq_1,\\
\frac{3}{4}m\ddot{q}_3-\frac{1}{4}m\ddot{q}_1&=&-kq_3,\\
4M\ddot{X}&=&0.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 5 =====


The last equation simply states that the center-of-mass velocity is
fixed. One could obtain the same result by summing the equations of
motion for $x_1$, $2x_2$ and $x_3$ above. The second two equations are
more complicated. To solve them, we assume a form

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
q_1&=&Ae^{i\omega t},\\
q_3&=&Be^{i\omega t},
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Because this is a linear equation, we can multiply the solution by a
constant and it will still be a solution. Thus, we can set $B=1$, then
solve for $A$, effectively solving for $A/B$. Putting this guess into
the equations of motion,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
-\frac{3}{4}\frac{A}{B}\omega^2+\frac{1}{4}\omega^2&=&-\omega_0^2\frac{A}{B},\\
-\frac{3}{4}\omega^2+\frac{1}{4}\frac{A}{B}\omega^2&=&-\omega_0^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 6 =====


This is two equations and two unknowns, $\omega^2$ and
$A/B$. Substituting for $A/B$ gives a quadratic equation,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\omega^4-3\omega_0^2\omega^2+2\omega_0^4&=&0,\\
\omega_0^2&\equiv&k/m.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

The two solutions are

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
(1)~~\omega&=&\omega_0,~~~A=-B,\\
(2)~~\omega&=&\omega_0\sqrt{2},~~~A=B.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

!split
===== Coupled Springs, Part 7 =====

The first solution corresponds to the two outer masses moving in
opposite directions, in sync, with the middle mass fixed. The second
solution has both outer masses moving in the same direction, but with
the center mass moving opposite. These two solutions are referred to
as normal modes, and are characterized by their frequency and by the
linear combinations of coordinates that oscillate together. In
general, the solution is a linear combination of normal modes, which
usually results in a chaotic looking motion. However, once the
solution is expressed in terms of the normal modes, each of which
oscillates independently in a simple manner, one can better understand
the motion. Further, the frequencies of these modes represent the
natural resonant frequencies of the system. This is important in the
construction of many structures, such as bridges or vehicles.

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 1 =====

Consider a double pendulum confined to the $x-y$ plane, where $y$ is
vertical. A mass $m$ is connected to the ceiling with a massless
string of length $\ell$. A second mass $m$ hangs from the first mass
with an identical massless string of the same length. Using $\theta_1$
and $\theta_2$ to describe the orientations of the strings relative to
the vertical axis, find the Lagrangian and derive the equations of
motion, both for arbitrary angles and in the small-angle
approximation. Finally, express the equations of motion in the limit
of small oscillations.

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 2 =====

The kinetic and potential energies are:

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
T&=&\frac{1}{2}m\ell^2\dot{\theta}_1^2
+\frac{1}{2}m\left\{(\ell\dot{\theta}_1\cos\theta_1+\ell\dot{\theta}_2\cos\theta_2)^2
+(\ell\dot{\theta}_1\sin\theta_1+\ell\dot{\theta}_2\sin\theta_2)^2\right\}\\
&=&\frac{1}{2}m\ell^2\left\{2\dot{\theta}_1^2+\dot{\theta}_2^2+2\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)
\right\},\\
U&=&mg\ell(1-\cos\theta_1)+mg\left[\ell(1-\cos\theta_1)+\ell(1-\cos\theta_2)\right]\\
&=&mg\ell(3-2\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2)
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 3 =====

Lagrange's equations for $\theta_1$ lead to

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
m\ell^2\frac{d}{dt}\left\{2\dot{\theta}_1+\dot{\theta}_2\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)\right\}&=&
-m\ell^2\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)
-2mg\ell\sin\theta_1,\\
2\ddot{\theta}_1+\ddot{\theta}_2\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)+\dot{\theta}_2^2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)
&=&-2\omega_0^2\sin\theta_1,\\
\omega_0^2&\equiv& g/\ell,
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

and the equations for $\theta_2$ are

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
m\ell^2\frac{d}{dt}\left\{\dot{\theta}_2+\dot{\theta}_1\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)\right\}&=&
m\ell^2\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)-mg\ell\sin\theta_2,\\
\ddot{\theta}_2+\ddot{\theta_1}\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)&=&
-\omega_0^2\sin\theta_2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 4 =====


For small oscillations, one can only consider terms linear in $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ or their derivatives,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
2\ddot{\theta}_1+\ddot{\theta}_2&=&-2\omega_0^2\theta_1,\\
\nonumber
\ddot{\theta}_1+\ddot{\theta}_2&=&-\omega_0^2\theta_2.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

To find the solutions, assume they are of the form
$\theta_1=Ae^{i\omega t}, \theta_2=Be^{i\omega t}$. Solve for $\omega$
and $A/B$, noting that $B$ is arbitrary.

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 5 =====


Plug in the desired form and find

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
e^{i\omega t}(-2\omega^2A-\omega^2B)&=&e^{i\omega t}(-2\omega_0^2A),\\
e^{i\omega t}(-\omega^2A-\omega^2B)&=&e^{i\omega t}(-\omega_0^2B).
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

We can treat $B$ as arbitrary and set it to unity. When we find $A$,
it is the same as $A/B$ for arbitrary $B$. This gives the equations

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
2\omega^2A+\omega^2&=&2\omega_0^2A,\\
\omega^2A+\omega^2&=&\omega_0^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 6 =====


This is two equations and two unknowns. Solving them leads to a
quadratic equation with solutions

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
A/B&=&\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\\
\omega^2&=&\frac{\omega_0^2}{1\pm 1/\sqrt{2}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Again, these two solutions are the normal modes, and the general
solution is a sum of the two solutions, with two arbitrary
constants. For the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are:

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_1&=&\frac{A_+}{\sqrt{2}}e^{i\omega_+t}, ~\theta_2=A_+e^{i\omega_+t},\\
\theta_1&=&\frac{-A_-}{\sqrt{2}}e^{i\omega_-t}, ~\theta_2=A_-e^{i\omega_-t},\\
\omega_{\pm}&=&\omega_0\sqrt{\frac{1}{1\pm 1/\sqrt{2}}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 7 =====


One can also express the solution in vector notation, with the vectors
having arbitrary amplitudes $A_+$ and $A_-$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_+&=&\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 1\end{array}\right)A_+e^{i\omega_+t},\\
\theta_-&=&\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\\ 1\end{array}\right)A_-e^{i\omega_-t}.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Here, the upper/lower components of the vector describe
$\theta_1/\theta_2$ respectively.


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 8 =====


These problems can be treated as linear algebra exercises. Linear
algebra is not used in this course, but nonetheless we describe how
this works for the curious student. In the limit of small vibrations,
the equations of motion can be expressed in the form,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
M\ddot{q}&=&-Kq,
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

a form that looks like the spring equation. However, $q$ is an
$n-$dimensional vector and $M$ and $k$ are $n\times n$ matrices. In
the double pendulum example, the dimensionality is 2 and the $q$
refers to the $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, and the matrices for $M$ and
$K$ can be read off as

!bt
\[
M=\begin{bmatrix} 2&1\\ 1&1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
K=\begin{bmatrix} 2\omega_0^2&0\\ 0&\omega_0^2\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 9 =====


Multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse matrix $M^{-1}$,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ddot{q}&=&-\left(M^{-1}K\right)q.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

Here,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
M^{-1}&=&\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1&-1\\
-1&2\end{array}\right),\\
M^{-1}K&=&\left(\begin{array}{cc}
2&-1\\
-2&2\end{array}\right)\omega_0^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 10 =====


One can find a transformation, basically a rotation, that transforms
to a frame where $M^{-1}K$ is diagonal. In this coordinate system the
diagonal components of $M^{-1}K$ represent the squared frequencies of
the normal modes,

!bt
\[
M^{-1}K\rightarrow -\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\omega_+^2&0\\
0&\omega_-^2\end{array}\right)~,
\]
!et

and are known as ``eigen'' frequencies. The corresponding unit vectors,

!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\0\end{array}\right)~{\rm and}~\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\1\end{array}\right)~{\rm in~the~new~coordinate~system},
\]
!et

can be rotated back into the original frame, and become the solutions
for the normal modes. These are then called ``eigenvectors'', which
are the same as the normal modes. Finding the eigenfrequencies is
performed by realizing that the determinant of a matrix is unchanged
by the rotation between coordinate systems. Writing the equations of
motion as an eigenvalue problem,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[A-\lambda_i\mathbb{1}\right]u_i&=&0,~~~A\equiv M^{-1}K,~\lambda_i\equiv \omega^2_i.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 11 =====


In the coordinate system where $M^{-1}K$ is diagonal, and the forms
for $u_i$ are simple this requires that in that system, the diagonal
elements of $M^{-1}K$ are the eigenvalues, $\omega_i^2$. For each
$\omega^2_i$, the determinant $|A-\lambda_i\mathbb{1}|$ must
vanish. This is then true in any coordinate system,


!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm det}\left[A-\lambda\mathbb{1}\right]&=&0,
\end{eqnarray}
!et

which for a $2\times 2$ matrix becomes

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
A_{11}-\lambda&A_{12}\\
A_{21}&A_{22}-\lambda
\end{array}
\right|&=&0,\\
A_{11}A_{22}-\lambda A_{11}-\lambda A_{22}+\lambda^2-A_{21}A_{12}&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


!split
===== Double Pendulum, Part 12 =====


One can solve a quadratic equation for $\lambda$, which gives two
eigenvalues corresponding to $\omega_+^2$ and $\omega_-^2$ found
above. Choosing one of the eigenvalues, one can insert one of the
eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ into the eigenvalue problem  and solve for $u_i$,
then choose the other eigenvalue and solve for the other corresponding
vector.

If this were a 3-dimensional set of equations, the determinant would
include terms like $\lambda^3$ and would become a cubic equation with
three eigenvalues. One would then solve for three eigenvectors. If one
has a system with dimensionality $n>2$, one usually resorts to solving
the problem numerically due to the messiness of the algebra. The main
programming languages all have packages which readily diagonalize
matrices and find eigenvectors and eigenvalues.


!split
===== Conservation Laws =====

Energy is conserved only when the Lagrangian has no explicit
dependence on time, i.e. $L(q,\dot{q})$, not $L(q,\dot{q},t)$. To show
this, we first define the Hamiltonian,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
H&=&\sum_i\left(\dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}\right)-L.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

After showing that $H$ is conserved, i.e. $(d/dt)H=0$, we then show
that $H$ can be identified with the total energy, $H=T+V$.

One can see that $H$ is conserved by applying first using the chain
rule for $(d/dt)H$, then applying Lagrange's
equations,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}H&=&\sum_i\left\{\ddot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}+\dot{q}_i\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}\ddot{q}_i-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\dot{q}_i\right\}\\
\nonumber
&=&\sum_i\left\{\ddot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}+\dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}\ddot{q}_i-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}\dot{q}_i\right\}\\
\nonumber
&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Convervation Laws, part 2 =====

These steps assumed that $L$ had no explicit time dependence, i.e. $L$
is a function of $q$ and $\dot{q}$, but not of $t$.

Next, we show that $L$ can be identified with the energy. Because $V$ does not depend on $\dot{q}$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
H=\sum_i\frac{\partial T}{\partial\dot{q}_i}\dot{q}_i-T+V.
\end{equation}
!et

If the kinetic energy has a purely quadratic form in terms of $\dot{q}$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
T=\sum_{ij}A_{ij}(q)\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j,
\end{equation}
!et

the expression for the energy  becomes

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
H&=&\sum_{ij}2A_{ij}(q)\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j-\sum_{ij}A_{ij}(q)\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j+V\\
\nonumber
&=&T+V.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Convervation Laws, part 3 =====


The proof that $H$ equals the energy hinged on the fact that the
kinetic energy was quadratic in $\dot{q}$. This can be attributed to
time-reversal symmetry. Because the Cartesian coordinates $x_i$ do not
depend on $\dot{q}_i$ or on time, $\dot{x}_i=(\partial x_i/\partial
q_j)\dot{q}_j$. Thus, the kinetic energy, $T=m\dot{x}_i^2/2$, should
be proportional to two powers of $\dot{q}$, which validates the
assumption above.


!split
===== Convervation Laws, part 4 =====


Here, energy conservation is predicated on the Lagrangian not having
an explicit time dependence. Without an explicit time dependence the
equations of motion are unchanged if one translates a fixed amount in
time because the physics does not depend on when the clock starts. In
contrast, the absolute time becomes relevant if there is an explicit
time dependence. In fact, conservation laws can usually be associated
with symmetries. In this case the translation symmetry in time leads
to energy conservation.

For another example of how symmetry leads to conservation laws,
consider a Lagrangian for a particle of mass $m$ moving in a
two-dimensional plane where the generalized coordinates are the radius
$r$ and the angle $\theta$. The kinetic energy would be

!bt
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{1}{2}m\left\{\dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta}^2\right\},
\end{equation}
!et

and if the potential energy $V(r)$ depends only on the radius $r$ and
not on the angle, Lagrange's equations become

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}(m\dot{r})&=&-\frac{\partial V}{\partial r}+m\dot{\theta}^2r,\\
\nonumber
\frac{d}{dt}(mr^2\dot{\theta})&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Convervation Laws, part 4 =====


The second equation implies that $mr^2\dot{\theta}$ is a
constant. Indeed, it is the angular momentum which is conserved for a
radial force. Here, the conservation of angular momentum is associated
with the independence of the physics to changes in $\theta$, or in
other words, rotational invariance. Once one knows the fact that
$L=mr^2\dot{\theta}$ is conserved, it can be inserted into the
equations of motion for $\dot{r}$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot{r}=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial r}+\frac{L^2}{mr^3}.
\end{equation}
!et

This is related to "Emmy Noether's theorem":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem"

Simply stated, if the Lagrangian $L$ is independent of $q_i$, one can
see that the quantity $\partial L/\partial\dot{q}_i$ is conserved,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_i}=0.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Convervation Laws, Another Example =====


Another easy example is in Cartesian coordinates where the potential
depends only on $x$ and $y$ but not on $z$. In that case, there is a
translational symmetry. From the last equation, this translates
into conservation of the momentum in the $z$ direction.


Consider a pair of particles of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ where the potential is of the form

!bt
\[
U(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2)=V_a(|m_1\bm{r}_1+m_2\bm{r}_2|/(m_1+m_2))+V_b(|\bm{r}_1-\bm{r}_2|).
\]
!et

Using symmetry arguments alone, are there any conserved components of
the momentum? or the angular momentum??

There is no translational invariance, hence there are no conserved
components of the momentum. However, there is rotational invariance
about any axis that goes through the origin. Hence, there is angular
momentum conservation in all three directions. Symmetry arguments are
great ways to recognize the existence of conserved quantities, but
actually expressing them in terms of coordinates can be tricky. For
instance, you may need to write the Lagrangian in terms of angles.

=== Exercise 1, Two-body Problems and Conservative Forces (total 35pt) ===

The relevant material can be found in Taylor chapters 4 and 8. Homework sets 5, 6-9 and the chapters on "forces":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter4.html" and "two-body problems":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter6.html" from the lecture notes may also be of use. 

This exercise and the next are  follow-ups of homework 6. There we studied the so-called
"Lennard-Jones potential":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" which is widely used in molecular dynamics
calculations and in the simulations of "quantum liquids":"https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.40.11070". This potential is based on parametrizations from
experiments. In "molecular dynamics calculations":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics" the assumption is
that atoms move according to the laws of Newton, given the correct
model for interactions. We can say then that quantum-mechanical
degrees of freedom stemming from complicated interactions between electrons
and protons in an atom, are parametrized in terms of an effective
potential.

We will limit ourselves to a two-body problem.

The goal of this exercise is to model a gas of argon atoms (here two
atoms only interacting), where the atoms interact according to the
famous Lennard-Jones potential,

!bt
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = 4\varepsilon\left((\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} - (\frac{\sigma}{r})^6\right), label{eq:lj}
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the distance between two atoms,
$r=\vert\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j\vert$, that is the norm of the relative
distance vector $\bm{r}$. The quantities $\sigma$ and $\varepsilon$ are
parameters which determine which chemical compound is modelled. This
potential is a good approximation for noble gases like helium, neon, argon and other.

We start first with a basic study of the potential

* _1a (5pt):_ Plot the potential as a function of $r$ with $\varepsilon=1$ and $\sigma=1$, for example for $r \in [0.9,3]$.
* _1b (5pt):_ The behaviour of $V(r)$ is vastly different for $r < \sigma$ and $r > \sigma$. Which term in the potential, (ref{eq:lj}), dominates in each case and what is the effect?
* _1c (5pt):_ Find and characterize the equilibrium points of the potential.
* _1d (5pt):_ Describe qualitatively the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of ${1.5}\sigma$. What if they start with a separation of ${0.95}\sigma$?  (Hint: use the graph of the potential.)

Then we switch our attention to the equations of motion.

* _1e (5pt):_ Find the force on atom $i$ at position $\bm{r}_i$ from atom $j$ at position $\bm{r}_j$. Is this a conservative force?
* _1f (5pt):_  Are linear and angular momentum conserved? You need to show this by calculating the relevant quantities. Hint: see homework set 4 and exercise 2.
* _1g (5pt):_ Show that the equation of motion for atom $i$ is
!bt
\[
  \frac{d^2\bm{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{24\varepsilon}{m} \sum_{j \neq i} \left(2(\frac{\sigma}{\vert\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j}\vert)^{12}-(\frac{\sigma}{\vert\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j}\vert)^6\right)\frac{\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j}{\vert\bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j\vert^2}.
\]

=== Exercise 2, Two-body Problems and Conservative Forces, Numerical Studies (50pt) ===

In this exercise we will solve the previous equations of motion numerically and study the solutions.
Here you can use the same codes you developed in homework sets 5-9 and the second midterm.

Numerical accuracy is reduced when computing with values which are
many orders of magnitude apart. This is often an issue in physics, and
molecular dynamics is no exception. For example, the mass of argon is
smaller than 10E-25kg, while typical length scales are
on the order of nanometers, 10E-9m.

The remedy is to change units so that most quantities are close to
$1$. From (ref{eq:lj}) it is clear that $\sigma$ and $\varepsilon$
are the typical scales for length and energy.

* _2a (5pt):_ Introduce the scaled coordinates $\bm{r}_i\,'=\bm{r}_i/\sigma$ and show that the equation of motion can be rewritten in terms of these coordinates as (where $t'=t/\tau$ for a suitable choice of $\tau$.)
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\bm{r}_i\,'}{{dt'^2}} = 24 \sum_{j \neq i} \left(2\vert\bm{r}_i\,'-\bm{r}_j\,'\vert^{-12}-\vert\bm{r}_i\,'-\bm{r}_j\,'\vert^{-6}\right)\frac{\bm{r}_i\,'-\bm{r}_j\,'}{\vert\bm{r}_i\,'-\bm{r}_j\,'\vert^2}, label{eq:undim}
\end{equation}
!et
* _2b (5pt):_ What is the characteristic time scale $\tau$, and what is its value for argon, which has $\sigma=3.405$Å (1Å=1E-10m), $m = 39.95u$ (with 1u=1.66E-27kg) and $\varepsilon=1.0318$ E-2eV (1eV=1.602E-19J)?



We switch now to a numerical procedure and study the simulation of two interacting atoms.
* _2c (10pt):_ Write a function which solves (ref{eq:undim}) for two atoms and find the positions and velocities of the atoms as a function of time. Implement either the Euler-Cromer or the Velocity-Verlet methods to solve the equations of motion (you can reuse your codes from homework sets 5-9 or the second midterm).


* _2d (5pt):_ Simulate the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of ${1.5}\sigma$. Use $\Delta t'={0.01}$, simulate until $t'=5$ and integrate with one of the above methods. Plot the distance between the atoms as a function of time. How does the motion fit with your expectations? What type of motion do you expect?
* _2e (5pt):_ Repeat the previous tasks, but now with an initial separation of $0.95\sigma$. Explain your results. 
* _2f (10pt):_ Compute and plot the kinetic, potential and total energy as a function of time for the time interval from exercise  2d and the initial conditions from 2d and 2e. Should the total energy be conserved? Why, or why not? Here you can use your codes from the second midterm for computing the energies.
* _2g (10pt):_ Is angular momentum conserved (see your answers to 1f). How would you show this numerically? Hint: see your answers to the second midterm, exercise 1c. 




=== Exercise 3, Lagrangian formalism and the Lennard-Jones potential (35pt) ===


The relevant chapters from Taylor are chapters 6-7 and 8. In addition he lectures
notes on the "Lagrangian Formalism and Calculus of
Variations":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter8.html" can be of use. You
need also results from the two-body problem of chapter 8 of Taylor and
the lecture notes "two-body
problems":"https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter6.html".


We will stay with a two-body problem only with particles $1$ and $2$, as in the two previous exercises.  
We introduce the relative mass $\mu=m_1m_2/M$ where the total mass $M=m_1+m_2$, the sum of the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.

* _3a (5pt):_ Define the center-of-mass position $\bm{R}$ and the relative position $\bm{r}$ in terms of the masses and the positions of particles one and two $\bm{r}_1$ and $\bm{r}_2$, respectively. Define then the center-of-mass frame by setting $\bm{R}=0$. Show then that you can write the total angular momentum as $\bm{L}=\mu(\bm{r}\times \dot{\bm{r}})$. Hint: See Taylor section 8.3. How do you interpret the angular momentum?  Why can we reduce the motion of two particles to a problem in two dimensions only?
* _3b (10pt):_ We introduce polar coordinates with $r\in [0,\infty)$ and $\phi\in[0,2\pi]$. The quantity $r$ is the absolute value (magnitude) of the relative distance. Show that you can write the kinetic energy as $K=1/2\mu(\dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\phi}^2)$.
* _3c (5pt):_ Include the potential energy for the Lennard-Jones potential and write out the Lagrangian using the coordinates $r$ and $\phi$. Does the potential energy depend on $\phi$?
* _3d (10pt):_ Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the equations of motion for $r$ and $\phi$. Does the equation of motion for $r$ agree with what you derived in exercise 1? Comment your results.
* _3e (5pt):_ Use the equation of motion for $\phi$ to show that angular momentum is conserved. Comment your results. Can you infer this from the form of the potential? Hint: see your answer to 3c.

=====  Competences and Skills =====

To solve many of these problems, we have through different midterms and weekly exercises studied many systems numerically, from falling objects with and without friction/air resistance, small oscillations (harmonic oscillator), gravitational problems and other central force problems, rotations and the classical pendulum. To solve these systems, we have applied different algorithms for solving differential equations. These are

o Runge-Kutta family of algorithms for time-dependent forces
We have also, in connection with for example the work-energy theorem studied methods for evaluating integrals. These are (although we never wrote codes in exercises/midterms)
o Numerical integration using the Trapezoidal, midpoint and Simpson's rule.

=====  Computations? Why? =====

You should also have acquired skills in structuring a numerical project, as well as having developed a critical understanding of the pros and cons of the methods and an understanding of their limits and what can go wrong.  Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering education.
In particular, some of the competences that are important in the development of your own understanding of
computations, we would like to emphasize
o derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
o understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
o overview of important, known algorithms for solving mechanics problems (To a extent large differential equations and integration)
o understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
o Making science (your results) reproducible
o algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

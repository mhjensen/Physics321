# PHY321, Classical Mechanics I, Michigan State University, Spring 2022


We have planned this class as a flipped class where we would like to
- use Mondays as regular lecture days
- Wednesdays as a mix of lectures and problem solving (or just one of them depending on needs and feedback from you). The first two weeks we will lecture both Monday and Wednesday.
- Fridays are planned as flipped classes, with problem solving and more.

We will have at our disposal room 1202 in the new STEM building.

You have probably seen that MSU plans to have most lectures in an
online format the first three weeks. Since we have a lots of space in
the new STEM building, we believe there is no problem in having
in-person lectures.

This means that for those of you who want and can
attend, we will have in-person lectures starting on Monday January
10. However, the lectures will be available online as well via
zoom. This will be done throughout the semester. It means that if you
cannot be there physically (for many reasons), you can always attend
via zoom. All lectures will be recorded and uploaded and made
available to you via D2L and MSU media space and the website of the
course. 


We will thus have in-person classes and the lectures/sessions will be
- made available to everybody via zoom as we teach (hybrid mode), you can attend from wherever you want. Zoom has also  live transcripts of the direct lecture;
- the videos will be posted right afterwards in case you could not attend (that is the video of the actual lecture, it is like a kind of podcast with movie). You can thus review the material which was discussed in peace whenever you want;
- We use always a whiteboard (iPad) instead of a blackboard and these handwritten notes are also posted after the lectures;
- We have  extensive online material, lecture notes, exercises, projects and more, see the GitHub site of the course at
https://github.com/mhjensen/Physics321, see https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter1.html for the online textbook land https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/web/course.html for the weekly material.
- We are going to make shorter videos which cover various topics and how to solve different exercises and more. They will be posted as we move on during the semester;


We have also created a Slack channel, see

## Learning outcomes

After the course you should:

- be able to analyze forces that act on objects, apply Newton’s laws to determine the equations of motion, and solve these analytically and numerically,
- Know about  inertial frames and their relation to accelerating and rotating frames (non-inertial frames)
- Know about forces, work, energy, angular momentum, linear momentum and conservation laws
- Know about  various types of motions, falling objects, objects moving in various fields
- Know how to analyze energy diagrams and defining effective potential
- Have knowledge about small oscillations, Harmonic oscillator potential and equations of motion
- Have knowledge about transformation of variables that allow for analytical solutions, example two-body problems
- Have knowledge about central forces and two-body problems, center-of-mass and relative coordinates as reference frame
- Have knowledge about two-body scattering problems, classical scattering cross section
- Have knowledge about Variational calculus and Lagrangian formalism
- Know how to derive the equations of motion from the Lagrangian formalism with and without constraints (Lagrangian multipliers)

To solve many of these problems, we have through different projects and weekly exercises studied many systems numerically, from falling objects with and without friction/air resistance, small oscillations (harmonic oscillator), gravitational problems and other central force problems, rotations and the classical pendulum. To solve these systems, we have applied different algorithms for solving differential equations. These are
- Euler-Cromer and Velocity-Verlet as energy conserving algorithms (time-independent forces)
- Runge-Kutta family of algorithms for time-dependent forces
We have also, in connection with for example the work-energy theorem studied methods for evaluating integrals. These are
- Numerical integration using the Trapezoidal, midpoint and Simpson's rule.

You should also have acquired skills in structuring a numerical project, as well as having developed a critical understanding of the pros and cons of the methods and an understanding of their limits and what can go wrong.  Computing means solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.  Computing competence has
always been a central part of the science and engineering education.
In particular, some of the competences that are important in the development of your own understanding of
computations, we would like to emphasize
- derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
- understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
- overview of important, known algorithms for solving mechanics problems (To a extent large differential equations and integration)
- understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
- Making science (your results) reproducible
- algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems

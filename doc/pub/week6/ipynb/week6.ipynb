    "\n",
    "A conservative force is a force whose property is that the total work\n",

    "taken path. This means that the work on an object under the influence\n",
    "of a conservative force, is independent on the path of the object. It\n",
    "depends only on the spatial degrees of freedom and it is possible to\n",
    "assign a numerical value for the potential at any point. It leads to\n",
    "conservation of energy. The gravitational force is an example of a\n",
    "conservative force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two important conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a conservative force depends only on the spatial degrees of freedom. This is a necessary condition for obtaining a path integral which is independent of path.\n",
    "The  important condition for the final work to be independent of the path is that the **curl** of the force is zero, that\n",

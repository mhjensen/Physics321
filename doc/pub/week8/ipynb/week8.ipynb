    "\n",
    "The harmonic oscillator is omnipresent in physics. Although you may think \n",
    "of this as being related to springs, it, or an equivalent\n",
    "mathematical representation, appears in just about any problem where a\n",
    "mode is sitting near its potential energy minimum. At that point,\n",
    "$\\partial_x V(x)=0$, and the first non-zero term (aside from a\n",
    "constant) in the potential energy is that of a harmonic oscillator. In\n",
    "a solid, sound modes (phonons) are built on a picture of coupled\n",
    "harmonic oscillators, and in relativistic field theory the fundamental\n",
    "interactions are also built on coupled oscillators positioned\n",
    "infinitesimally close to one another in space. The phenomena of a\n",
    "resonance of an oscillator driven at a fixed frequency plays out\n",
    "repeatedly in atomic, nuclear and high-energy physics, when quantum\n",
    "mechanically the evolution of a state oscillates according to\n",
    "$e^{-iEt}$ and exciting discrete quantum states has very similar\n",
    "mathematics as exciting discrete states of an oscillator.\n",

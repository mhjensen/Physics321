    "## Classical mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over\n",
    "several centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of\n",
    "presenting the educational material, normally the first **real** physics\n",
    "course many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics\n",
    "studies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the\n",
    "underlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding\n",
    "of the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights\n",
    "and deeper understanding about physical systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## From Continuous to Discretized Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wealth of\n",
    "well-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical\n",
    "standpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved\n",
    "analytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and\n",
    "less realistic situations.  The large majority of these problems are\n",
    "solved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed\n",
    "at what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution.  As a consequence,\n",
    "when teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case\n",
    "in order to develop our understandings and insights about the\n",
    "underlying forces and laws of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim at changing this here by introducing throughout the course what\n",
    "we will call a **computational path**, where with computations we mean\n",
    "solving scientific problems with all possible tools and means, from\n",
    "plain paper an pencil exercises, via symbolic calculations to writing\n",
    "a code and running a program to solve a specific\n",
    "problem. Mathematically this normally means that we move from a\n",
    "continuous problem to a discretized one. This appproach enables us to\n",
    "solve a much broader class of problems.\n",
    "In mechanics this means, since we often rephrase the physical problems in terms of differential equations, that we can in most settings reuse the same program with some minimal changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space, Time, Motion, Reference Frames  and Reminder on vectors and other mathematical quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "Our studies will start with the motion of different types of objects\n",
    "such as a falling ball, a runner, a bicycle etc etc. It means that an\n",
    "object's position in space varies with time.\n",
    "In order to study such systems we need to define\n",
    "\n",
    "* choice of origin\n",
    "\n",
    "* choice of the direction of the axes\n",
    "\n",
    "* choice of positive direction (left-handed or right-handed system of reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "* choice of units and dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "These choices lead to some important questions such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the  physics of a system independent of the origin of the axes?\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the  physics independent of the directions of the axes, that is are there privileged axes?\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the physics independent of the orientation of system?\n",
    "\n",
    "* is the physics independent of the scale of the length?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimension, units and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we will use the standardized SI units. The standard unit for length is thus one meter 1m, for mass\n",
    "one kilogram 1kg, for time one second 1s, for force one Newton 1kgm/s$^2$ and for energy 1 Joule 1kgm$^2$s$^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following notations for various variables (vectors are always boldfaced in these lecture notes):\n",
    "* position $\\boldsymbol{r}$, in one dimention we will normally just use $x$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* mass $m$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* time $t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}$ or just $v$ in one dimension,\n",
    "\n",
    "* acceleration $\\boldsymbol{a}$ or just $a$ in one dimension,\n",
    "\n",
    "* momentum $\\boldsymbol{p}$ or just $p$ in one dimension,\n",
    "\n",
    "* kinetic energy $K$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* potential energy $V$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "* frequency $\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More variables will be defined as we need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensions and Units\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to keep track of dimensionalities. Don't mix this\n",
    "up with a chosen unit for a given variable. We mark the dimensionality\n",
    "in these lectures as $[a]$, where $a$ is the quantity we are\n",
    "interested in. Thus\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[\\boldsymbol{r}]=$ length\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[m]=$ mass\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[K]=$ energy\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[t]=$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[\\boldsymbol{v}]=$ length over time\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[\\boldsymbol{a}]=$ length over time squared\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[\\boldsymbol{p}]=$ mass times length over time\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[\\omega]=$ 1/time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars, Vectors and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar is something with a value that is independent of coordinate\n",
    "system. Examples are mass, or the relative time between events. A\n",
    "vector has magnitude and direction. Under rotation, the magnitude\n",
    "stays the same but the direction changes. Scalars have no spatial\n",
    "index, whereas a three-dimensional vector has 3 indices, e.g. the\n",
    "position $\\boldsymbol{r}$ has components $r_1,r_2,r_3$, which are often\n",
    "referred to as $x,y,z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several categories of changes of coordinate system. The\n",
    "observer can translate the origin, might move with a different\n",
    "velocity, or might rotate her/his coordinate axes. For instance, a\n",
    "particle's position vector changes when the origin is translated, but\n",
    "its velocity does not. When you study relativity you will find that\n",
    "quantities you thought of as scalars, such as time or an electric\n",
    "potential, are actually parts of four-dimensional vectors and that\n",
    "changes of the velocity of the reference frame act in a similar way to\n",
    "rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to vectors and scalars, there are matrices, which have two\n",
    "indices. One also has objects with 3 or four indices. These are called\n",
    "tensors of rank $n$, where $n$ is the number of indices. A matrix is a\n",
    "rank-two tensor. The Levi-Civita symbol, $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ used for\n",
    "cross products of vectors, is a tensor of rank three.\n",

<h2 id="___sec2">Classical mechanics </h2>

<p>
Classical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over
several centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of
presenting the educational material, normally the first <b>real</b> physics
course many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics
studies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the
underlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding
of the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights
and deeper understanding about physical systems.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec3">From Continuous to Discretized Approaches </h2>

<p>
There is a wealth of
well-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical
standpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved
analytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and
less realistic situations.  The large majority of these problems are
solved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed
at what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution.  As a consequence,
when teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case
in order to develop our understandings and insights about the
underlying forces and laws of motion.

<p>
We aim at changing this here by introducing throughout the course what
we will call a <b>computational path</b>, where with computations we mean
solving scientific problems with all possible tools and means, from
plain paper an pencil exercises, via symbolic calculations to writing
a code and running a program to solve a specific
problem. Mathematically this normally means that we move from a
continuous problem to a discretized one. This appproach enables us to
solve a much broader class of problems.
In mechanics this means, since we often rephrase the physical problems in terms of differential equations, that we can in most settings reuse the same program with some minimal changes.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec4">Space, Time, Motion, Reference Frames  and Reminder on vectors and other mathematical quantities </h2>

<p>
Our studies will start with the motion of different types of objects
such as a falling ball, a runner, a bicycle etc etc. It means that an
object's position in space varies with time.
In order to study such systems we need to define

<ul>
<li> choice of origin</li>
<li> choice of the direction of the axes</li>
<li> choice of positive direction (left-handed or right-handed system of reference)</li>
<li> choice of units and dimensions</li>
</ul>

These choices lead to some important questions such as

<ul>
<li> is the  physics of a system independent of the origin of the axes?</li>
<li> is the  physics independent of the directions of the axes, that is are there privileged axes?</li>
<li> is the physics independent of the orientation of system?</li>
<li> is the physics independent of the scale of the length?</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec5">Dimension, units and labels </h2>

<p>
Throughout this course we will use the standardized SI units. The standard unit for length is thus one meter 1m, for mass
one kilogram 1kg, for time one second 1s, for force one Newton 1kgm/s$^2$ and for energy 1 Joule 1kgm$^2$s$^{-2}$.

<p>
We will use the following notations for various variables (vectors are always boldfaced in these lecture notes):

<ul>
<li> position \( \boldsymbol{r} \), in one dimention we will normally just use \( x \),</li>
<li> mass \( m \),</li>
<li> time \( t \),</li>
<li> velocity \( \boldsymbol{v} \) or just \( v \) in one dimension,</li>
<li> acceleration \( \boldsymbol{a} \) or just \( a \) in one dimension,</li>
<li> momentum \( \boldsymbol{p} \) or just \( p \) in one dimension,</li>
<li> kinetic energy \( K \),</li>
<li> potential energy \( V \) and</li>
<li> frequency \( \omega \).</li>
</ul>

More variables will be defined as we need them.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec6">Dimensions and Units </h2>

<p>
It is also important to keep track of dimensionalities. Don't mix this
up with a chosen unit for a given variable. We mark the dimensionality
in these lectures as \( [a] \), where \( a \) is the quantity we are
interested in. Thus

<ul>
<li> \( [\boldsymbol{r}]= \) length</li>
<li> \( [m]= \) mass</li>
<li> \( [K]= \) energy</li>
<li> \( [t]= \) time</li>
<li> \( [\boldsymbol{v}]= \) length over time</li>
<li> \( [\boldsymbol{a}]= \) length over time squared</li>
<li> \( [\boldsymbol{p}]= \) mass times length over time</li>
<li> \( [\omega]= \) 1/time</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec7">Scalars, Vectors and Matrices </h2>

<p>
A scalar is something with a value that is independent of coordinate
system. Examples are mass, or the relative time between events. A
vector has magnitude and direction. Under rotation, the magnitude
stays the same but the direction changes. Scalars have no spatial
index, whereas a three-dimensional vector has 3 indices, e.g. the
position \( \boldsymbol{r} \) has components \( r_1,r_2,r_3 \), which are often
referred to as \( x,y,z \).

<p>
There are several categories of changes of coordinate system. The
observer can translate the origin, might move with a different
velocity, or might rotate her/his coordinate axes. For instance, a
particle's position vector changes when the origin is translated, but
its velocity does not. When you study relativity you will find that
quantities you thought of as scalars, such as time or an electric
potential, are actually parts of four-dimensional vectors and that
changes of the velocity of the reference frame act in a similar way to
rotations.

<p>
In addition to vectors and scalars, there are matrices, which have two
indices. One also has objects with 3 or four indices. These are called
tensors of rank \( n \), where \( n \) is the number of indices. A matrix is a
rank-two tensor. The Levi-Civita symbol, \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) used for
cross products of vectors, is a tensor of rank three.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec8">Definitions  of Vectors </h2>

<p>
In these lectures we will use boldfaced lower-case letters to label a
vector. A vector \( \boldsymbol{a} \) in three dimensions is thus defined as

$$
\boldsymbol{a} =(a_x,a_y, a_z),
$$

and using the unit vectors (see below) in a cartesian system we have
$$
\boldsymbol{a} = a_x\boldsymbol{e}_1+a_y\boldsymbol{e}_2+a_z\boldsymbol{e}_3,
$$

<p>
where the unit vectors have magnitude \( \vert\boldsymbol{e}_i\vert = 1 \) with
\( i=1=x \), \( i=2=y \) and \( i=3=z \). Some authors use letters
\( \boldsymbol{i}=\boldsymbol{e}_1 \), \( \boldsymbol{j}=\boldsymbol{e}_2 \) and \( \boldsymbol{k}=\boldsymbol{e}_3 \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec9">Other ways to define a Vector </h2>

<p>
Alternatively, you may also encounter the above vector as
$$
\boldsymbol{a} = a_1\boldsymbol{e}_1+a_2\boldsymbol{e}_2+a_3\boldsymbol{e}_3.
$$

<p>
Here we have used that \( a_1=a_x \), \( a_2=a_y \) and \( a_3=a_z \). Such a
notation is sometimes more convenient if we wish to represent vector
operations in a mathematically more compact way, see below here. We may also find this useful if  we want the different
components to represent other coordinate systems that the Cartesian one. A typical example would be going from a Cartesian representation to a spherical basis. We will encounter such cases many times in this course.

<p>
We use lower-case letters for vectors and upper-case letters for matrices. Vectors and matrices are always boldfaced.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec10">Polar Coordinates </h2>

<p>
As an example, consider a two-dimensional Cartesian system with a vector \( \boldsymbol{r}=(x,y) \).
Our vector is then written as
$$
\boldsymbol{r} = x\boldsymbol{e}_1+y\boldsymbol{e}_2.
$$

<p>
Transforming to polar coordinates with the radius \( \rho\in [0,\infty) \)
and the angle \( \phi \in [0,2\pi] \) we have the familiar transformations

$$
x = \rho \cos{\phi} \hspace{0.5cm}   y = \rho \sin{\phi},
$$

<p>
and the inverse relations 

$$
\rho =\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \hspace{0.5cm}   \phi = \mathrm{arctan}(\frac{y}{x}).
$$

<p>
We can rewrite the vector \( \boldsymbol{a} \) in terms of \( \rho \) and \( \phi \) as

$$
\boldsymbol{a} = \rho \cos{\phi}\boldsymbol{e}_1+\rho \sin{\phi}\boldsymbol{e}_2,
$$

<p>
and we define the new unit vectors as \( \boldsymbol{e}'_1=\cos{\phi}\boldsymbol{e}_1 \) and \( \boldsymbol{e}'_2=\sin{\phi}\boldsymbol{e}_2 \), we have

$$
\boldsymbol{a}' = \rho\boldsymbol{e}'_1+\rho \boldsymbol{e}'_2.
$$

<p>
Below we will show that the norms of this vector in a Cartesian basis and a Polar basis are equal.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec11">Unit Vectors </h2>

<p>
Also known as basis vectors, unit vectors point in the direction of
the coordinate axes, have unit norm, and are orthogonal to one
another. Sometimes this is referred to as an orthonormal basis,

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{e}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{e}_j=\delta_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0& 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\label{_auto1}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Here, \( \delta_{ij} \) is unity when \( i=j \) and is zero otherwise. This is
called the unit matrix, because you can multiply it with any other
matrix and not change the matrix. The <b>dot</b> denotes the dot product,
\( \boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{b}=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3=|a||b|\cos\theta_{ab} \). Sometimes
the unit vectors are called \( \hat{x} \), \( \hat{y} \) and
\( \hat{z} \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec12">Our definition of unit vectors </h2>

<p>
Vectors can be decomposed in terms of unit vectors,

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{r}=r_1\hat{e}_1+r_2\hat{e}_2+r_3\hat{e}_3.
\label{_auto2}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
The vector components \( r_1 \), \( r_2 \) and \( r_3 \) might be
called \( x \), \( y \) and \( z \) for a displacement. Another way to write this is to define the vector \( \boldsymbol{r}=(x,y,z) \).

<p>
Similarly, for the velocity we will use in this course the components  \( \boldsymbol{v}=(v_x, v_y,v_z \). The accelaration is then given by \( \boldsymbol{a}=(a_x,a_y,a_z) \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec13">More definitions, repeated indices </h2>

<p>
As mentioned above, repeated indices infer sums.
This means that when you encounter an expression like the one on the left-hand side here, it stands actually for a sum (right-hand side)

$$
x_iy_i=\sum_i x_iy_i=\boldsymbol{x}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}.
$$

<p>
We will in our lectures seldom use this notation and rather spell out the summations.  This inferred summation over indices is normally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation" target="_blank">Einstein summation convention</a>.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec14">Vector Operations, Scalar Product (or dot product) </h2>

<p>
For two vectors \( \boldsymbol{a} \) and \( \boldsymbol{b} \) we have

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{b}&=&\sum_ia_ib_i=|a||b|\cos\theta_{ab},\\
|a|&\equiv& \sqrt{\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{a}},
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

or with a norm-2 notation
$$
|a|\equiv \vert\vert \boldsymbol{a}\vert\vert_2=\sqrt{\sum_i a_i^2}.
$$

<p>
Not of all of you are familiar with linear algebra. Numerically we will always deal with arrays and the dot product vector is given by the product of the transposed vector multiplied with the other vector, that is we have
$$
\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{b}=\sum_i a_ib_i=|a||b|\cos\theta_{ab}.
$$

The superscript \( T \) represents the transposition operations.

<p>
As an example, consider a three-dimensional velocity defined by a vector \( \boldsymbol{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z) \). For those of you familiar with linear algebra, we would write this quantity as
$$
\boldsymbol{v}=\begin{bmatrix} v_x\\ v_y \\ v_z \end{bmatrix},
$$

<p>
and the transpose as
$$
\boldsymbol{v}^T=\begin{bmatrix} v_x & v_y &v_z \end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>
The norm is
$$
\boldsymbol{v}^T\boldsymbol{v}=v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2,
$$

as it should.

<p>
Since we will use Python as a programming language throughout this course, the above vector, using the package <b>numpy</b> (see discussions below), can be written as

<h2 id="___sec16">Norm of a transformed Vector </h2>

<p>
As an example, consider our transformation of a two-dimensional Cartesian vector \( \boldsymbol{r} \) to polar coordinates.
We had
$$
\boldsymbol{r} = x\boldsymbol{e}_1+y\boldsymbol{e}_2.
$$

<p>
Transforming to polar coordinates with the radius \( \rho\in [0,\infty) \)
and the angle \( \phi \in [0,2\pi] \) we have 

$$
x = \rho \cos{\phi} \hspace{0.5cm}   y = \rho \sin{\phi}.
$$

We can write this 
$$
\boldsymbol{r} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \rho \cos{\phi}  \\ \rho \sin{\phi}  \end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>
The norm in Cartesian coordinates is \( \boldsymbol{r}\cdot\boldsymbol{r}=x^2+y^2 \) and
using Polar coordinates we have
\( \rho^2(\cos{\phi})^2+\rho^2(\cos{\phi})^2=\rho^2 \), which shows that
the norm is conserved since we have \( \rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \). A
transformation to a new basis should not change the norm.

<p>
Here \( \epsilon \) is the third-rank anti-symmetric tensor, also known as
the Levi-Civita symbol. It is \( \pm 1 \) only if all three indices are
different, and is zero otherwise. The choice of \( \pm 1 \) depends on
whether the indices are an even or odd permutation of the original
symbols. The permutation \( xyz \) or \( 123 \) is considered to be \( +1 \). Its elements are

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_{ijk}&=&-\epsilon_{ikj}=-\epsilon_{jik}=-\epsilon_{kji}\\
\nonumber
\epsilon_{123}&=&\epsilon_{231}=\epsilon_{312}=1,\\

<h2 id="___sec18">More on cross-products </h2>

<p>
You may have met cross-products when studying magnetic
fields. Because the matrix is anti-symmetric, switching the \( x \) and
\( y \) axes (or any two axes) flips the sign. If the coordinate system is
right-handed, meaning the \( xyz \) axes satisfy
\( \hat{x}\times\hat{y}=\hat{z} \), where you can point along the \( x \) axis
with your extended right index finger, the \( y \) axis with your
contracted middle finger and the \( z \) axis with your extended
thumb. Switching to a left-handed system flips the sign of the vector
\( \boldsymbol{c}=\boldsymbol{a}\times\boldsymbol{b} \).

<p>
Note that
\( \boldsymbol{a}\times\boldsymbol{b}=-\boldsymbol{b}\times\boldsymbol{a} \). The vector \( \boldsymbol{c} \) is
perpendicular to both \( \boldsymbol{a} \) and \( \boldsymbol{b} \) and the magnitude of
\( \boldsymbol{c} \) is given by

$$
|c|=|a||b|\sin{\theta_{ab}}.

<h2 id="___sec19">Pseudo-vectors </h2>

<p>
Vectors obtained by the cross product of two real vectors are called
pseudo-vectors because the assignment of their direction can be
arbitrarily flipped by defining the Levi-Civita symbol to be based on
left-handed rules. Examples are the magnetic field and angular
momentum. If the direction of a real vector prefers the right-handed
over the left-handed direction, that constitutes a violation of
parity. For instance, one can polarize the spins (angular momentum) of
nuclei with a magnetic field so that the spins preferentially point
along the direction of the magnetic field. This does not violate
parity because both are pseudo-vectors. Now assume these polarized
nuclei decay and that electrons are one of the products. If these
electrons prefer to exit the decay parallel vs. antiparallel to the
polarizing magnetic field, this constitutes parity violation because
the direction of the outgoing electron momenta are a real vector. This
is precisely what is observed in weak decays.

We can repeat these operations for the cross products and show that they are distribuitive

Even though it is the same vector, the components have changed. Each

previous vectors,

$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{e}'_i=\sum_j U_{ij}\hat{e}_j,

and the matrix \( U \) can be found by taking the dot product of both sides with \( \hat{e}_k \),

A tensor obeying Eq. \eqref{eq:transposedef} defines what is known as

The matrix \( U \) can be used to transform any vector to the new basis. Consider a vector

$$
\begin{eqnarray}

&=&r'_1\hat{e}'_1+r'_2\hat{e}'_2+r'_3\hat{e}'_3.

$$

<p>
This is the same vector expressed as a sum over two different sets of
basis vectors. The coefficients \( r_i \) and \( r'_i \) represent components
of the same vector. The relation between them can be found by taking
the dot product of each side with one of the unit vectors,
\( \hat{e}_i \), which gives

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
r_i&=&\sum_j \hat{e}_i\cdot\hat{e}'_j~r'_j.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Using Eq. \eqref{eq:inverseU} one can see that the transformation of \( r \) can be also written in terms of \( U \),

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:rotateR}
r_i&=&\sum_jU^{-1}_{ij}~r'_j.

Physical quantities with no spatial indices are scalars (or
pseudoscalars if they depend on right-handed vs. left-handed
coordinate systems), and are unchanged by unitary
transformations. This includes quantities like the trace of a matrix,
the matrix itself had indices but none remain after performing the
trace.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Tr} M&\equiv& M_{ii}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
Because there are no remaining indices, one expects it to be a scalar. Indeed one can see this,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Tr} M'&=&U_{ij}M_{jm}U^{-1}_{mi}\\
\nonumber
&=&M_{jm}U^{-1}_{mi}U_{ij}\\
\nonumber
&=&M_{jm}\delta_{mj}\\
\nonumber
&=&M_{jj}={\rm Tr} M.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
A similar example is the determinant of a matrix, which is also a scalar.

<h2 id="___sec38">Numerical Elements </h2>

<p>
Numerical algorithms call for approximate discrete models and much of
the development of methods for continuous models are nowadays being
replaced by methods for discrete models in science and industry,
simply because <b>much larger classes of problems can be addressed</b> with
discrete models, often by simpler and more generic methodologies.

<p>
As we will see throughout this course, when properly scaling the equations at hand,
discrete models open up for more advanced abstractions and the possibility to
study  real life systems, with the added bonus that we can explore and
deepen our basic understanding of various physical systems

<p>
Analytical solutions are as important as before. In addition, such
solutions provide us with invaluable benchmarks and tests for our
discrete models. Such benchmarks, as we will see below, allow us 
to discuss possible sources of errors and their behaviors.  And
finally, since most of our models are based on various algorithms from
numerical mathematics, we have a unique oppotunity to gain a deeper
understanding of the mathematical approaches we are using.

<p>
With computing and data science as important elements in essentially
all aspects of a modern society, we could  then try to define Computing as
<b>solving scientific problems using all possible tools, including
symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical
paper and pencil solutions</b>. 
Computing provides us with the tools to develope our own understanding of the scientific method by enhancing algorithmic thinking.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec39">Computations and the Scientific Method </h2>

<p>
The way we will teach this course reflects this definition of
computing. The course contains both classical paper and pencil
exercises as well as computational projects and exercises. The hope is
that this will allow you to explore the physics of systems governed by
the degrees of freedom of classical mechanics at a deeper level, and
that these insights about the scientific method will help you to
develop a better understanding of how the underlying forces and
equations of motion and how they impact a given system.

<p>
Furthermore,
by introducing various numerical methods via computational projects
and exercises, we aim at developing your competences and skills about
these topics.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec40">Computational Competences </h2>

<p>
These competences will enable you to

<ul>
<li> understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,</li>
<li> derive, verify, and implement algorithms,</li>
<li> understand what can go wrong with algorithms,</li>
<li> use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and</li>
<li> think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.</li>
</ul>

All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process <em>per se</em>.

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
<em>However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.</em>

<h2 id="___sec41">A well-known examples to illustrate many of the above concepts </h2>

<p>
Before we venture into a reminder on Python and mechanics relevant applications, let us briefly outline some of the
abovementioned topics using an example many of you may have seen before in for example CMSE201. 
A simple algorithm for integration is the Trapezoidal rule. 
Integration of a function \( f(x) \) by the Trapezoidal Rule is given by following algorithm for an interval \( x \in [a,b] \)
$$
  \int_a^b(f(x) dx = \frac{1}{2}\left [f(a)+2f(a+h)+\dots+2f(b-h)+f(b)\right] +O(h^2),
$$

where \( h \) is the so-called stepsize defined by the number of integration points \( N \) as \( h=(b-a)/(n) \).
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for
the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show an
example code with the <b>trapezoidal rule</b>. We use also <b>SymPy</b> to evaluate the exact value of the integral and compute the absolute error
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
\( \int_0^1 dx x^2 = 1/3 \).
The following code for  the trapezoidal rule allows you  to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to \( 10^8 \) points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.

<h2 id="___sec42">Analyzing the above example </h2>

<p>
This example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms
with symbolic calculations, allowing us to

<ul>
<li> Validate and verify  their  algorithms.</li> 
<li> Including concepts like unit testing, one has the possibility to test and test several or all parts of the code.</li>
<li> Validation and verification are then included <em>naturally</em> and one can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.</li>
<li> The above example allows the student to also test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. The students get <b>trained from day one to think error analysis</b>.</li> 
<li> With a Jupyter notebook you can keep exploring similar examples and turn them in as your own notebooks.</li>

<h2 id="___sec43">Python practicalities, Software and needed installations </h2>

<p>
We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
myriad of available libraries.  You will find
Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.

<p>
If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel
pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
you install the following Python packages via <b>pip</b> as 

<ol>
<li> pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow</li> 
</ol>

For Python3, replace <b>pip</b> with <b>pip3</b>.

<p>
For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
install <b>brew</b>. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
software via for example 

<ol>
<li> brew install python3</li>
</ol>

For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
you can use <b>pip</b> as well and simply install Python as 

<ol>
<li> sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)</li>
</ol>

etc etc.

<h2 id="___sec44">Python installers </h2>

<p>
If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
dependencies for Python, namely 

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>,</li> 
</ul>

which is an open source
distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
are managed by the package management system <b>conda</b>. 

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought canopy</a></li> 
</ul>

is a Python

<h2 id="___sec46">Numpy examples and Important Matrix and vector handling packages </h2>

<p>
There are several central software libraries for linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. Several of the more
popular ones have been wrapped into ofter software packages like those from the widely used text <b>Numerical Recipes</b>. The original source codes in many of the available packages are often taken from the widely used
software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages
developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.  We describe them shortly here.

<ul>
  <li> LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.</li>
  <li> LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website <a href="http://www.netlib.org" target="_blank"><tt>http://www.netlib.org</tt></a> it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.</li>
  <li> BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations.

<h2 id="___sec47">Numpy and arrays </h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">Numpy</a> provides an easy way to handle arrays in Python. The standard way to import this library is as

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">numpy</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">np</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Here follows a simple example where we set up an array of ten elements, all determined by random numbers drawn according to the normal distribution,
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>n <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">10</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> np<span style="color: #666666">.</span>random<span style="color: #666666">.</span>normal(size<span style="color: #666666">=</span>n)
<span style="color: #008000">print</span>(x)
</pre></div>
<p>
We defined a vector \( x \) with \( n=10 \) elements with its values given by the Normal distribution \( N(0,1) \).
Another alternative is to declare a vector as follows
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">numpy</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">np</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> np<span style="color: #666666">.</span>array([<span style="color: #666666">1</span>, <span style="color: #666666">2</span>, <span style="color: #666666">3</span>])
<span style="color: #008000">print</span>(x)
</pre></div>
<p>
Here we have defined a vector with three elements, with \( x_0=1 \), \( x_1=2 \) and \( x_2=3 \). Note that both Python and C++
start numbering array elements from \( 0 \) and on. This means that a vector with \( n \) elements has a sequence of entities \( x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1} \). We could also let (recommended) Numpy to compute the logarithms of a specific array as
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">numpy</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">np</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> np<span style="color: #666666">.</span>log(np<span style="color: #666666">.</span>array([<span style="color: #666666">4</span>, <span style="color: #666666">7</span>, <span style="color: #666666">8</span>]))
<span style="color: #008000">print</span>(x)
</pre></div>
<p>
In the last example we used Numpy's unary function \( np.log \). This function is
highly tuned to compute array elements since the code is vectorized
and does not require looping. We normaly recommend that you use the
Numpy intrinsic functions instead of the corresponding <b>log</b> function
from Python's <b>math</b> module. The looping is done explicitely by the
<b>np.log</b> function. The alternative, and slower way to compute the
logarithms of a vector would be to write

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">numpy</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">np</span>

    x[i] <span style="color: #666666">=</span> log(x[i])
<span style="color: #008000">print</span>(x)
</pre></div>
<p>
We note that our code is much longer already and we need to import the <b>log</b> function from the <b>math</b> module. 
The attentive reader will also notice that the output is \( [1, 1, 2] \). Python interprets automagically our numbers as integers (like the <b>automatic</b> keyword in C++). To change this we could define our array elements to be double precision numbers as
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">numpy</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">as</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">np</span>

<p>
or simply write them as double precision numbers (Python uses 64 bits as default for floating point type variables), that is

Having defined vectors, we are now ready to try out matrices. We can
define a \( 3 \times 3  \) real matrix \( \hat{A} \) as (recall that we user
lowercase letters for vectors and uppercase letters for matrices)

If we use the <b>shape</b> function we would get \( (3, 3) \) as output, that is verifying that our matrix is a \( 3\times 3 \) matrix. We can slice the matrix and print for example the first column (Python organized matrix elements in a row-major order, see below) as

Numpy contains many other functionalities that allow us to slice, subdivide etc etc arrays. We strongly recommend that you look up the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">Numpy website for more details</a>. Useful functions when defining a matrix are the <b>np.zeros</b> function which declares a matrix of a given dimension and sets all elements to zero

<h2 id="___sec49">Meet the Pandas </h2>

<p>
<br /><br /><center><p><img src="fig/pandas.jpg" align="bottom" width=600></p></center><br /><br />

<p>
Another useful Python package is
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a>, which is an open source library
providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data
analysis tools for Python. <b>pandas</b> stands for panel data, a term borrowed from econometrics and is an efficient library for data analysis with an emphasis on tabular data.

<p>
<b>pandas</b> has two major classes, the <b>DataFrame</b> class with
two-dimensional data objects and tabular data organized in columns and
the class <b>Series</b> with a focus on one-dimensional data objects. Both
classes allow you to index data easily as we will see in the examples
below.  <b>pandas</b> allows you also to perform mathematical operations on
the data, spanning from simple reshapings of vectors and matrices to
statistical operations.

<p>
The following simple example shows how we can, in an easy way make
tables of our data. Here we define a data set which includes names,
place of birth and date of birth, and displays the data in an easy to
read way. We will see repeated use of <b>pandas</b>, in particular in
connection with classification of data.

<p>
In the above we have imported <b>pandas</b> with the shorthand <b>pd</b>, the latter has become the standard way we import <b>pandas</b>. We make then a list of various variables
and reorganize the above lists into a <b>DataFrame</b> and then print out  a neat table with specific column labels as <em>Name</em>, <em>place of birth</em> and <em>date of birth</em>.
Displaying these results, we see that the indices are given by the default numbers from zero to three.
<b>pandas</b> is extremely flexible and we can easily change the above indices by defining a new type of indexing as

Thereafter we display the content of the row which begins with the index <b>Aragorn</b>

We can easily append data to this, for example

<p>
Here are other examples where we use the <b>DataFrame</b> functionality to handle arrays, now with more interesting features for us, namely numbers. We set up a matrix 
of dimensionality \( 10\times 5 \) and compute the mean value and standard deviation of each column. Similarly, we can perform mathematial operations like squaring the matrix elements and many other operations.

and many other operations.

<p>
The <b>Series</b> class is another important class included in
<b>pandas</b>. You can view it as a specialization of <b>DataFrame</b> but where
we have just a single column of data. It shares many of the same
features as <b>DataFrame</b>. As with <b>DataFrame</b>, most operations are
vectorized, achieving thereby a high performance when dealing with
computations of arrays, in particular labeled arrays.  As we will see
below it leads also to a very concice code close to the mathematical
operations we may be interested in.  For multidimensional arrays, we
recommend strongly
<a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">xarray</a>. <b>xarray</b> has much of
the same flexibility as <b>pandas</b>, but allows for the extension to
higher dimensions than two.

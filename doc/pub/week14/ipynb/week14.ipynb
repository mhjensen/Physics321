    "## Scattering and Cross Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering experiments don't measure entire trajectories. For elastic\n",
    "collisions, they measure the distribution of final scattering angles\n",
    "at best. Most experiments use targets thin enough so that the number\n",
    "of scatterings is typically zero or one. The cross section, $\\sigma$,\n",
    "describes the cross-sectional area for particles to scatter with an\n",
    "individual target atom or nucleus. Cross section measurements form the\n",
    "basis for MANY fields of physics. BThe cross section, and the\n",
    "differential cross section, encapsulates everything measurable for a\n",
    "collision where all that is measured is the final state, e.g. the\n",
    "outgoing particle had momentum $\\boldsymbol{p}_f$. y studying cross sections,\n",
    "one can infer information about the potential interaction between the\n",
    "two particles. Inferring, or constraining, the potential from the\n",
    "cross section is a classic {\\it inverse} problem. Collisions are\n",
    "either elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions are those for which\n",
    "the two bodies are in the same internal state before and after the\n",
    "collision. If the collision excites one of the participants into a\n",
    "higher state, or transforms the particles into different species, or\n",
    "creates additional particles, the collision is inelastic. Here, we\n",
    "consider only elastic collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scattering: Coulomb forces\n",
    "\n",
    "For Coulomb forces, the cross section is infinite because the range of\n",
    "the Coulomb force is infinite, but for interactions such as the strong\n",
    "interaction in nuclear or particle physics, there is no long-range\n",
    "force and cross-sections are finite. Even for Coulomb forces, the part\n",
    "of the cross section that corresponds to a specific scattering angle,\n",
    "$d\\sigma/d\\Omega$, which is a function of the scattering angle\n",
    "$\\theta_s$ is still finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a particle travels through a thin target, the chance the particle\n",
    "scatters is $P_{\\rm scatt}=\\sigma dN/dA$, where $dN/dA$ is the number\n",
    "of scattering centers per area the particle encounters. If the density\n",
    "of the target is $\\rho$ particles per volume, and if the thickness of\n",
    "the target is $t$, the areal density (number of target scatterers per\n",
    "area) is $dN/dA=\\rho t$. Because one wishes to quantify the collisions\n",
    "independently of the target, experimentalists measure scattering\n",
    "probabilities, then divide by the areal density to obtain\n",
    "cross-sections,"

    "\n",
    "The code example here is meant to illustrate how we can make a plot of the final orbit. We solve the equations in polar coordinates (the example here uses the minimum of the potential as initial value) and then we transform back to cartesian coordinates and plot $x$ versus $y$. We see that we get a perfect circle when we place ourselves at the minimum of the potential energy, as expected."

<p>Conservative forces and potential energy. Reading suggestion: Taylor sections 4.2-4.4</p>

<p>If you wish to read more about conservative forces or not, Feyman's lectures from 1963 are quite interesting.
He states for example that <b>All fundamental forces in nature appear to be conservative</b>.
This statement was made while developing his argument that <em>there are no nonconservative forces</em>.

<p>We discuss other force models with examples such as the gravitational
force and a spring force. See Malthe-S&#248;renssen chapter 7.3-7.5. We
start our discussion of energy and work, see Taylor 4.1
</p>

<p>We discuss also exercise 5 from homework 2.</p>

<h2 id="work-energy-momentum-and-conservation-laws">Work, Energy, Momentum and Conservation laws </h2>

<p>The previous three cases have shown us how to use Newton&#8217;s laws of
motion to determine the motion of an object based on the forces acting
on it. For two of the cases there is an underlying assumption that we can find an analytical solution to a continuous problem.
With a continuous problem we mean a problem where the various variables can take any value within a finite or infinite interval. 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in many cases we
cannot find an exact solution to the equations of motion we get from
Newton&#8217;s second law. The numerical approach, where we discretize the continuous problem, allows us however to study a much richer set of problems.
For problems involving Newton's laws and the various equations of motion we encounter, solving the equations numerically, is the standard approach.
</p>

<p>It allows us to focus on the underlying forces. Often we end up using the same numerical algorithm for different problems.</p>

<p>Here we introduce a commonly used technique that allows us to find the
velocity as a function of position without finding the position as a
function of time&#8212;an alternate form of Newton&#8217;s second law. The method
is based on a simple principle: Instead of solving the equations of
motion directly, we integrate the equations of motion. Such a method
is called an integration method. 
</p>

<p>This allows us also to introduce the <b>work-energy</b> theorem. This
theorem allows us to find the velocity as a function of position for
an object even in cases when we cannot solve the equations of
motion. This introduces us to the concept of work and kinetic energy,
an energy related to the motion of an object.
</p>

<p>And finally, we will link the work-energy theorem with the principle of conservation of energy.</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="the-work-energy-theorem">The Work-Energy Theorem </h2>

<p>Let us define the kinetic energy \( K \) with a given velocity \( \boldsymbol{v} \)</p>
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2,
$$

<p>where \( m \) is the mass of the object we are considering.
We assume also that there is a force \( \boldsymbol{F} \) acting on the given object
</p>

$$
\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{v},t),
$$

<p>with \( \boldsymbol{r} \) the position and \( t \) the time.
In general we assume the force is a function of all these variables.
Many of the more central forces in Nature however, depende only on the
position. Examples are the gravitational force and the force derived
from the Coulomb potential in electromagnetism.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="rewriting-the-kinetic-energy">Rewriting the Kinetic Energy </h2>

<p>Let us study the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to time \( t \). Its continuous form is</p>
$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}. 
$$

<p>Using our results from exercise 3 of homework 1, we can write the derivative of a vector dot product as</p>

$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}= \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}+\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\right)=m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}. 
$$

<p>We know also that the acceleration is defined as</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\boldsymbol{F}}{m}=\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}.
$$

<p>We can then rewrite the equation for the derivative of the kinetic energy as </p>
$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{F}\frac{d\boldsymbol{r}}{dt}, 
$$

<p>where we defined the velocity as the derivative of the position with respect to time.</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="discretizing">Discretizing </h2>

<p>Let us now discretize the above equation by letting the instantaneous terms be replaced by a discrete quantity, that is
we let \( dK\rightarrow \Delta K \), \( dt\rightarrow \Delta t \), \( d\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \Delta \boldsymbol{r} \) and \( d\boldsymbol{v}\rightarrow \Delta \boldsymbol{v} \).
</p>

<p>We have then</p>

$$
\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta t}=m\frac{\Delta \boldsymbol{v}}{\Delta t}\boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{F}\frac{\Delta \boldsymbol{r}}{\Delta t}, 
$$

<p>or by multiplying out \( \Delta t \) we have</p>
$$
\Delta K=\boldsymbol{F}\Delta \boldsymbol{r}. 
$$

<p>We define this quantity as the <b>work</b> done by the force \( \boldsymbol{F} \)
during the displacement \( \Delta \boldsymbol{r} \). If we study the dimensionality
of this problem we have mass times length squared divided by time
squared, or just dimension energy.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="difference-in-kinetic-energy">Difference in kinetic energy </h2>

<p>If we now define a series of such displacements \( \Delta\boldsymbol{r} \) we have a difference in kinetic energy at a final position \( \boldsymbol{r}_n \) and an 
initial position \( \boldsymbol{r}_0 \) given by
</p>
$$
\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}mv_n^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2=\sum_{i=0}^n\boldsymbol{F}_i\Delta \boldsymbol{r},
$$

<p>where \( \boldsymbol{F}_i \) are the forces acting at every position \( \boldsymbol{r}_i \).</p>

<p>The work done by acting with a force on a set of displacements can
then be as expressed as the difference between the initial and final
kinetic energies.
</p>

<p>This defines the <b>work-energy</b> theorem.</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="from-the-discrete-version-to-the-continuous-version">From the discrete version to the continuous version </h2>

<p>If we take the limit \( \Delta \boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow 0 \), we can rewrite the sum over the various displacements in terms of an integral, that is</p>
$$
\Delta K=\frac{1}{2}mv_n^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2=\sum_{i=0}^n\boldsymbol{F}_i\Delta \boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \int_{\boldsymbol{r}_0}^{\boldsymbol{r}_n}\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{v},t)d\boldsymbol{r}.
$$

<p>This integral defines a path integral since it will depend on the given path we take between the two end points. We will replace the limits with the symbol \( c \) in order to indicate that we take a specific countour in space when the force acts on the system. That is the work \( W_{n0} \) between two points \( \boldsymbol{r}_n \) and \( \boldsymbol{r}_0 \) is labeled as</p>
$$
W_{n0}=\frac{1}{2}mv_n^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2=\int_{c}\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{v},t)d\boldsymbol{r}.
$$

<p>Note that if the force is perpendicular to the displacement, then the force does not affect the kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Let us now study some examples of forces and how to find the velocity from the integration over a given path.</p>

<p>Thereafter we study how to  evaluate an integral numerically.</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="studying-the-work-energy-theorem-numerically">Studying the Work-energy Theorem numerically </h2>

<p>In order to study the work- energy, we will normally need to perform
a numerical integration, unless we can integrate analytically. Here we
present some of the simpler  methods such as the <b>rectangle</b> rule, the <b>trapezoidal</b> rule and higher-order methods like the Simpson family of methods.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="example-of-an-electron-moving-along-a-surface">Example of an Electron moving along a Surface </h2>

<p>As an example, let us consider the following case.
We have  classical electron which moves in the \( x \)-direction along a surface. The force from the surface is
</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{F}(x)=-F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\boldsymbol{e}_1.
$$

<p>The constant \( b \) represents the distance between atoms at the surface of the material, \( F_0 \) is a constant and \( x \) is the position of the electron.</p>

<p>Using the work-energy theorem we can find the work \( W \) done when moving an electron from a position \( x_0 \) to a final position \( x \) through the
 integral
</p>
$$
W=\int_{x_0}^x \boldsymbol{F}(x')dx' =  -\int_{x_0}^x F_0\sin{(\frac{2\pi x'}{b})} dx', 
$$

<p>which results in</p>
$$
W=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right].
$$


<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="finding-the-velocity">Finding the Velocity </h2>

<p>If we now use the work-energy theorem we can find the the velocity at a final position \( x \) by setting up
the differences in kinetic energies between the final position and the initial position \( x_0 \).
</p>

<p>We have that the work done by the force is given by the difference in kinetic energies as</p>
$$
W=\frac{1}{2}m\left(v^2(x)-v^2(x_0)\right)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right],
$$

<p>and labeling \( v(x_0)=v_0 \) (and assuming we know the initial velocity) we have</p>
$$
v(x)=\pm \sqrt{v_0^2+\frac{F_0b}{m\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]},
$$

<p>Choosing $x_0=0$m and $v_0=0$m/s we can simplify the above equation to</p>
$$
v(x)=\pm \sqrt{\frac{F_0b}{m\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-1\right]},
$$


<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="harmonic-oscillations">Harmonic Oscillations </h2>

<p>Another well-known force (and we will derive when we come to Harmonic
Oscillations) is the case of a sliding block attached to a wall
through a spring. The block is attached to a spring with spring
constant \( k \). The other end of the spring is attached to the wall at
the origin \( x=0 \).  We assume the spring has an equilibrium length
\( L_0 \).
</p>

<p>The force \( F_x \) from the spring on the block is then</p>
$$
F_x=-k(x-L_0).
$$

<p>The position \( x \) where the spring force is zero is called the equilibrium position. In our case this is
\( x=L_0 \).
</p>

<p>We can now compute the work done by this force when we move our block from an initial position \( x_0 \) to a final position \( x \)</p>
$$
W=\int_{x_0}^{x}F_xdx'=-k\int_{x_0}^{x}(x'-L_0)dx'=\frac{1}{2}k(x_0-L_0)^2-\frac{1}{2}k(x-L_0)^2.
$$

<p>A conservative force is a force whose property is that the total work
done in moving an object between two points is independent of the
taken path. This means that the work on an object under the influence
of a conservative force, is independent on the path of the object. It
depends only on the spatial degrees of freedom and it is possible to
assign a numerical value for the potential at any point. It leads to
conservation of energy. The gravitational force is an example of a
conservative force.

<p>The potential energy, due to energy conservation is</p>
$$
V(x)=V(x_0)+\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2-\frac{1}{2}mv^2,
$$

<p>with \( v \) given by the velocity from above.</p>

<p>We can now, in order to find a more explicit expression for the
potential energy at a given value \( x \), define a zero level value for
the potential. The potential is defined, using the work-energy
theorem, as
</p>

$$
V(x)=V(x_0)+\int_{x_0}^x (-F(x'))dx',
$$

<p>and if you recall the definition of the indefinite integral, we can rewrite this as</p>

$$
V(x)=\int (-F(x'))dx'+C,
$$

<p>where \( C \) is an undefined constant. The force is defined as the
gradient of the potential, and in that case the undefined constant
vanishes. The constant does not affect the force we derive from the
potential.
</p>

<p>We have then</p>
$$
V(x)=V(x_0)-\int_{x_0}^x \boldsymbol{F}(x')dx',
$$

<p>which results in</p>
$$
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}-\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}\right]+V(x_0).
$$

<p>We can now define</p>
$$
\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\cos{(\frac{2\pi x_0}{b})}=V(x_0),
$$

<p>which gives </p>
$$
V(x)=\frac{F_0b}{2\pi}\left[\cos{(\frac{2\pi x}{b})}\right].
$$

<h2 id="force-and-potential">Force and Potential </h2>

<p>We have defined work as the energy resulting from a net force acting
on an object (or sseveral objects), that is
</p>

$$
W(\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})= \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r})d\boldsymbol{r}.
$$

<p>If we write out this for each component we have</p>

$$
W(\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})=\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r})d\boldsymbol{r}=F_xdx+F_ydy+F_zdz.
$$

<p>The work done from an initial position to a final one defines also the difference in potential energies</p>

$$
W(\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})=-\left[V(\boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})-V(\boldsymbol{r})\right].
$$

<h2 id="getting-to-boldsymbol-f-boldsymbol-r-boldsymbol-nabla-v-boldsymbol-r">Getting to \( \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r})=-\boldsymbol{\nabla} V(\boldsymbol{r}) \) </h2>

<p>We can write out the differences in potential energies as</p>

$$
V(\boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})-V(\boldsymbol{r})=V(x+dx,y+dy,z+dz)-V(x,y,z)=dV,
$$

<p>and using the expression the differential of a multi-variable function \( f(x,y,z) \) </p>
$$
df=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz,
$$

<p>we can write the expression for the work done as</p>
$$
W(\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})=-dV=-\left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}dz \right].
$$

<p>Comparing the last equation with </p>
$$
W(\boldsymbol{r}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{r}+d\boldsymbol{r})=F_xdx+F_ydy+F_zdz,
$$

<p>we have</p>
$$
F_xdx+F_ydy+F_zdz=-\left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}dz \right],
$$

<p>leading to</p>
$$
F_x=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x},
$$

<p>and</p>
$$
F_y=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial y},
$$

<p>and</p>
$$
F_z=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial z},
$$

<p>or just</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{F}=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{e}_1-\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{e}_2-\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\boldsymbol{e}_3=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}V(\boldsymbol{r}).
$$

<p>And this connection is the one we wanted to show.</p>

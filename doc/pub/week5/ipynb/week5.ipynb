    "The systems we studied the first three weeks have shown us how to use Newton’s laws of\n",
    "motion to determine the motion of an object based on the forces acting\n",
    "on it. For some of the cases there is an underlying assumption that we can find an analytical solution to a continuous problem.\n",
    "With a continuous problem we mean a problem where the various variables can take any value within a finite or infinite interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in many cases we\n",
    "cannot find an exact solution to the equations of motion we get from\n",
    "Newton’s second law. The numerical approach, where we discretize the continuous problem, allows us however to study a much richer set of problems.\n",
    "For problems involving Newton's laws and the various equations of motion we encounter, solving the equations numerically, is the standard approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to focus on the underlying forces. Often we end up using the same numerical algorithm for different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we introduce a commonly used technique that allows us to find the\n",
    "velocity as a function of position without finding the position as a\n",
    "function of time—an alternate form of Newton’s second law. The method\n",
    "is based on a simple principle: Instead of solving the equations of\n",
    "motion directly, we integrate the equations of motion. Such a method\n",
    "is called an integration method. \n",

    "an energy related to the motion of an object.\n",

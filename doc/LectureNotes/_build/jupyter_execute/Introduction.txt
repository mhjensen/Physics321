# Introduction

Classical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over
several centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of
presenting the educational material, normally the first **real** physics
course many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics
studies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the
underlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding
of the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights
and deeper understanding about physical systems.  

There is a wealth of
well-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical
standpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved
analytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and
less realistic situations.  The large majority of these problems are
solved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed
at what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution.  As a consequence,
when teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case
in order to develop our understandings and insights about the
underlying forces and laws of motion.


On the other hand, numerical algorithms call for approximate discrete
models and much of the development of methods for continuous models
are nowadays being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and
industry, simply because **much larger classes of problems can be addressed** with discrete models, often  by simpler and more
generic methodologies.

As we will see below, when properly scaling the equations at hand,
discrete models open up for more advanced abstractions and the possibility to
study  real life systems, with the added bonus that we can explore and
deepen our basic understanding of various physical systems

Analytical solutions are as important as before. In addition, such
solutions provide us with invaluable benchmarks and tests for our
discrete models. Such benchmarks, as we will see below, allow us 
to discuss possible sources of errors and their behaviors.  And
finally, since most of our models are based on various algorithms from
numerical mathematics, we have a unique oppotunity to gain a deeper
understanding of the mathematical approaches we are using.



With computing and data science as important elements in essentially
all aspects of a modern society, we could  then try to define Computing as
**solving scientific problems using all possible tools, including
symbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical
paper and pencil solutions**. 
Computing provides us with the tools to develope our own understanding of the scientific method by enhancing algorithmic thinking.


The way we will teach this course reflects
this definition of computing. The course contains both classical paper
and pencil exercises as well as  computational projects and exercises. The
hope is that this will allow you to explore the physics of systems
governed by the degrees of freedom of classical mechanics at a deeper
level, and that these insights about the scientific method will help
you to develop a better understanding of how the underlying forces and
equations of motion and how they impact a given system. Furthermore, by introducing various numerical methods
via computational projects and exercises, we aim at developing your competences and skills about these topics.


These competences will enable you to

* understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,

* derive, verify, and implement algorithms,

* understand what can go wrong with algorithms,

* use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and

* think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.

All these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process *per se*.

The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

*However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.*

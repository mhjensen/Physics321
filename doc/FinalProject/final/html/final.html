<ol>
<li> You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. <b>Remember to write your name(s)</b>!</li>
<li> How do I(we)  hand in?  Due to the extraordinary situation we are in now, the final projec should be handed in fully via D2L. You can scan your handwritten notes and upload to D2L or you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="introduction-to-the-final-project-total-score-110-points">Introduction to the final project, total score: 110  points </h3>

<p>The relevant reading background is</p>
<ol>
<li> chapters 2-8 and 14 of Taylor</li>
<li> lecture notes throughout the semester and previous homework and midterm projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final project aims at covering most of the topics we have
discussed during the semester. You should feel free to use either
paper and pencil and/or symbolic software (sympy, Mathematica or
similar) for the non-computational exercises.
</p>
<h3 id="exercise-1-two-body-problems-and-conservative-forces-total-35pt">Exercise 1, Two-body Problems and Conservative Forces (total 35pt) </h3>

<p>The relevant material can be found in Taylor chapters 4 and 8. Homework sets 5, 6-9 and the chapters on <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter4.html" target="_blank">forces</a> and <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter6.html" target="_blank">two-body problems</a> from the lecture notes may also be of use. </p>

<p>This exercise and the next are  follow-ups of homework 6. There we studied the so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" target="_blank">Lennard-Jones potential</a> which is widely used in molecular dynamics
calculations and in the simulations of <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.40.11070" target="_blank">quantum liquids</a>. This potential is based on parametrizations from
experiments. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics" target="_blank">molecular dynamics calculations</a> the assumption is
that atoms move according to the laws of Newton, given the correct
model for interactions. We can say then that quantum-mechanical
degrees of freedom stemming from complicated interactions between electrons
and protons in an atom, are parametrized in terms of an effective
potential.
</p>

<p>We will limit ourselves to a two-body problem.</p>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to model a gas of argon atoms (here two
atoms only interacting), where the atoms interact according to the
famous Lennard-Jones potential,
</p>

$$
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = 4\varepsilon\left((\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} - (\frac{\sigma}{r})^6\right), \label{eq:lj}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>where \( r \) is the distance between two atoms,
\( r=\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i-\boldsymbol{r}_j\vert \), that is the norm of the relative
distance vector \( \boldsymbol{r} \). The quantities \( \sigma \) and \( \varepsilon \) are
parameters which determine which chemical compound is modelled. This
potential is a good approximation for noble gases like helium, neon, argon and other.
</p>

<p>We start first with a basic study of the potential</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>1a (5pt):</b> Plot the potential as a function of \( r \) with \( \varepsilon=1 \) and \( \sigma=1 \), for example for \( r \in [0.9,3] \).</li>
<li> <b>1b (5pt):</b> The behaviour of \( V(r) \) is vastly different for \( r < \sigma \) and \( r > \sigma \). Which term in the potential, \eqref{eq:lj}, dominates in each case and what is the effect?</li>
<li> <b>1c (5pt):</b> Find and characterize the equilibrium points of the potential.</li>
<li> <b>1d (5pt):</b> Describe qualitatively the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \( {1.5}\sigma \). What if they start with a separation of \( {0.95}\sigma \)?  (Hint: use the graph of the potential.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we switch our attention to the equations of motion.</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>1e (5pt):</b> Find the force on atom \( i \) at position \( \boldsymbol{r}_i \) from atom \( j \) at position \( \boldsymbol{r}_j \). Is this a conservative force?</li>
<li> <b>1f (5pt):</b>  Are linear and angular momentum conserved? You need to show this by calculating the relevant quantities. Hint: see homework set 4 and exercise 2.</li>
<li> <b>1g (5pt):</b> Show that the equation of motion for atom \( i \) is</li>
</ul>
$$
  \frac{d^2\boldsymbol{r}_i}{dt^2} = \frac{24\varepsilon}{m} \sum_{j \neq i} \left(2(\frac{\sigma}{\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i-\boldsymbol{r}_j}\vert)^{12}-(\frac{\sigma}{\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i-\boldsymbol{r}_j}\vert)^6\right)\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_i-\boldsymbol{r}_j}{\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i-\boldsymbol{r}_j\vert^2}.
$$
<h3 id="exercise-2-two-body-problems-and-conservative-forces-numerical-studies-50pt">Exercise 2, Two-body Problems and Conservative Forces, Numerical Studies (50pt) </h3>

<p>In this exercise we will solve the previous equations of motion numerically and study the solutions.
Here you can use the same codes you developed in homework sets 5-9 and the second midterm.
</p>

<p>Numerical accuracy is reduced when computing with values which are
many orders of magnitude apart. This is often an issue in physics, and
molecular dynamics is no exception. For example, the mass of argon is
smaller than 10E-25kg, while typical length scales are
on the order of nanometers, 10E-9m.
</p>

<p>The remedy is to change units so that most quantities are close to
\( 1 \). From \eqref{eq:lj} it is clear that \( \sigma \) and \( \varepsilon \)
are the typical scales for length and energy.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>2a (5pt):</b> Introduce the scaled coordinates \( \boldsymbol{r}_i\,'=\boldsymbol{r}_i/\sigma \) and show that the equation of motion can be rewritten in terms of these coordinates as (where \( t'=t/\tau \) for a suitable choice of \( \tau \).)</li>
</ul>
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\boldsymbol{r}_i\,'}{{dt'^2}} = 24 \sum_{j \neq i} \left(2\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i\,'-\boldsymbol{r}_j\,'\vert^{-12}-\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i\,'-\boldsymbol{r}_j\,'\vert^{-6}\right)\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_i\,'-\boldsymbol{r}_j\,'}{\vert\boldsymbol{r}_i\,'-\boldsymbol{r}_j\,'\vert^2}, \label{eq:undim}
\end{equation}
$$

<ul>
<li> <b>2b (5pt):</b> What is the characteristic time scale \( \tau \), and what is its value for argon, which has \( \sigma=3.405 \)&#197; (1&#197;=1E-10m), \( m = 39.95u \) (with 1u=1.66E-27kg) and \( \varepsilon=1.0318 \) E-2eV (1eV=1.602E-19J)?</li>
</ul>
<p>We switch now to a numerical procedure and study the simulation of two interacting atoms.</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>2c (10pt):</b> Write a function which solves \eqref{eq:undim} for two atoms and find the positions and velocities of the atoms as a function of time. Implement either the Euler-Cromer or the Velocity-Verlet methods to solve the equations of motion (you can reuse your codes from homework sets 5-9 or the second midterm).</li>
<li> <b>2d (5pt):</b> Simulate the motion of two atoms which start at rest separated by a distance of \( {1.5}\sigma \). Use \( \Delta t'={0.01} \), simulate until \( t'=5 \) and integrate with one of the above methods. Plot the distance between the atoms as a function of time. How does the motion fit with your expectations? What type of motion do you expect?</li>
<li> <b>2e (5pt):</b> Repeat the previous tasks, but now with an initial separation of \( 0.95\sigma \). Explain your results.</li> 
<li> <b>2f (10pt):</b> Compute and plot the kinetic, potential and total energy as a function of time for the time interval from exercise  2d and the initial conditions from 2d and 2e. Should the total energy be conserved? Why, or why not? Here you can use your codes from the second midterm for computing the energies.</li>
<li> <b>2g (10pt):</b> Is angular momentum conserved (see your answers to 1f). How would you show this numerically? Hint: see your answers to the second midterm, exercise 1c.</li> 
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-3-lagrangian-formalism-and-the-lennard-jones-potential-35pt">Exercise 3, Lagrangian formalism and the Lennard-Jones potential (35pt) </h3>

<p>The relevant chapters from Taylor are chapters 6-7 and 8. In addition he lectures
notes on the <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter8.html" target="_blank">Lagrangian Formalism and Calculus of
Variations</a> can be of use. You
need also results from the two-body problem of chapter 8 of Taylor and
the lecture notes <a href="https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/chapter6.html" target="_blank">two-body
problems</a>.
</p>

<p>We will stay with a two-body problem only with particles \( 1 \) and \( 2 \), as in the two previous exercises.  
We introduce the relative mass \( \mu=m_1m_2/M \) where the total mass \( M=m_1+m_2 \), the sum of the masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \).
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>3a (5pt):</b> Define the center-of-mass position \( \boldsymbol{R} \) and the relative position \( \boldsymbol{r} \) in terms of the masses and the positions of particles one and two \( \boldsymbol{r}_1 \) and \( \boldsymbol{r}_2 \), respectively. Define then the center-of-mass frame by setting \( \boldsymbol{R}=0 \). Show then that you can write the total angular momentum as \( \boldsymbol{L}=\mu(\boldsymbol{r}\times \ddot{\boldsymbol{r}} \). Hint: See Taylor section 8.3. How do you interpret the angular momentum?  Why can we reduce the motion of two particles to a problem in two dimensions only?</li>
<li> <b>3b (10pt):</b> We introduce polar coordinates with \( r\in [0,\infty) \) and \( \phi\in[0,2\pi] \). The quantity \( r \) is the absolute value (magnitude) of the relative distance. Show that you can write the kinetic energy as \( K=1/2\mu(\ddot{r}^2+r^2\ddot{\phi}^2) \).</li>
<li> <b>3c (5pt):</b> Include the potential energy for the Lennard-Jones potential and write out the Lagrangian using the coordinates \( r \) and \( \phi \). Does the potential energy depend on \( phi \)?</li>
<li> <b>3d (10pt):</b> Use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the equations of motion for \( r \) and \( \phi \). Does the equation of motion for \( r \) agree with what you derived in exercise 1? Comment your results.</li>
<li> <b>3e (5pt):</b> Use the equation of motion for \( \phi \) to show that angular momentum is conserved. Comment your results. Can you infer this from the form of the potential? Hint: see your answer to 3c.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classical-mechanics-extra-credit-assignment-scientific-writing-and-attending-talks">Classical Mechanics Extra Credit Assignment: Scientific Writing and attending Talks </h3>

<p>The following gives you an opportunity to earn <b>five extra credit
points</b> on each of the remaining homeworks and <b>ten extra credit points</b>
on the midterms and finals.  This assignment also covers an aspect of
the scientific process that is not taught in most undergraduate
programs: scientific writing.  Writing scientific reports is how
scientist communicate their results to the rest of the field.  Knowing
how to assemble a well written scientific report will greatly benefit
you in you upper level classes, in graduate school, and in the work
place.
</p>

<p>The full information on extra credits is found at <a href="https://github.com/mhjensen/Physics321/blob/master/doc/Homeworks/ExtraCredits/" target="_blank"><tt>https://github.com/mhjensen/Physics321/blob/master/doc/Homeworks/ExtraCredits/</tt></a>. There you will also find examples on how to write a scientific article. 
Below you can also find a description on how to gain extra credits by attending scientific talks.
</p>

<p>This assignment allows you to gain extra credit points by practicing
your scientific writing.  For each of the remaining homeworks you can
submit the specified section of a scientific report (written about the
numerical aspect of the homework) for five extra credit points on the
assignment.  For the two midterms and the final, submitting a full
scientific report covering the numerical analysis problem will be
worth ten extra points.  For credit the grader must be able to tell
that you put effort into the assignment (i.e. well written, well
formatted, etc.).  If you are unfamiliar with writing scientific
reports, <a href="https://github.com/mhjensen/Physics321/blob/master/doc/Homeworks/ExtraCredits/IntroductionScientificWriting.md" target="_blank">see the information here</a>
</p>

<p>The following table explains what aspect of a scientific report is due
with which homework.  You can submit the assignment in any format you
like, in the same document as your homework, or in a different one.
Remember to cite any external references you use and include a
reference list.  There are no length requirements, but make sure what
you turn in is complete and through.  If you have any questions,
please contact Julie Butler at butler@frib.msu.edu.

    " \n",
    "### Last Week:\n",
    "- Learned how to implement numerical integrations with the Trapezoidal rule\n",
    "- Calculated the mass and center of mass of objects using numerical integration\n",
    "- Introduced a package, SciPy, that can perform integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Week:\n",
    "- Challenge Euler's method! (Scary stuff. You don't want to mess with Euler, his name is on just about everything!)\n",
    "- Introduce the Velocity Verlet Method for computation\n",
    "- Study planetary motion using both these computational methods (at a very basic level)\n",

    "#### Let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a planetary system in 2D that consists of a star with nearly the same properties of our own Sun and one planet with nearly the same properties of our Earth. \n",

    "##### How do we model this system?\n",
    "Well that's a great question! We can use simple computational analysis with classical equations we are all familiar with. Let's begin by looking at one of the most essential equations of Physics, the gravitational force equation:\n",

Newton's gravitational constant is $G=6.67*10^{-11}$ m$^3$/kg/s$^2$. Those are **HUGE** numbers to compute with, and inconvenient to say the least.  Furthermore, it takes $3.2*10^7$ seconds (one year) for the Earth to make one orbit of the sun, so we see that MKS units may not be the best for doing our calculation here.\n",

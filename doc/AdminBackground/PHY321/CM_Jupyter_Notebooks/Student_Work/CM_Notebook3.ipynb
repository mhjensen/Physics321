It can be determined by dividing the interval we are analyzing, which in our case is time $(t)$, by the number of steps we are taking $(N)$. Thus step size $h = \\dfrac{t}{N}$. However, do notice that in the example below we define our range $t$, and step size $h$, making $N = \\dfrac{t}{h}$ the dependent variable in our case.\n",

    "\n",
    "eq 1.)$$L = T - V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is called the \"Lagrangian\". Here, $T$ is our kinetic energy, and $V$ is our potential energy. \n",
    "We construct the Lagrangian $L$ by determining $T$ and $V$ in terms of whatever variables are most convenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note the minus sign! $L$ is **NOT** the total energy!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangians are a key component of physics, the concepts helping to lay the foundations of more modern topics such as Quantum Field Theory.  They are also incredibly useful in practice.  Since energies are scalar quantities, they are often much easier to construct than vector quantities like force and acceleration, especially when using non-Cartesian coordinates or when there are constraints on the system.\n",

    "2. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a hand-written document. Alternatively, you can hand in everyhting (if you are ok with typing mathematical formulae using say Latex) as a jupyter notebook at D2L. The numerical part should always be handed in as a jupyter notebook by the deadline at D2L. \n",

Make a plot of three distinct positions with initial conditions $x_0=d$ and $v_0=0.5$ m/s, $x_0=d$ and $v_0=1.5$ m/s, and $x_0=d$ and $v_0=2.5$ m/s. Plot also the velocity.

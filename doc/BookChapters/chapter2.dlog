*** error: file has a mako construction ${}^2$ is a constant representing the standard acceleration due to gravity.
We have here adopted the conventional standard value. This does not take into account other effects, such as buoyancy or drag.
Furthermore, we stop when the ball hits the ground, which takes place at
!bt
\[
y(t) = 0= y_0-\frac{1}'
    but seemingly no definition in <%...%>'
    (it is not a command-line given mako variable either).
    However, if this is a variable in a Makefile or Bash script
    run with --no_mako - and you cannot use mako and Makefile or Bash variables
    in the same document!
